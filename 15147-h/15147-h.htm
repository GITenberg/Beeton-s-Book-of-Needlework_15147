 <a name="PREFACE"></a>
<h3>SAMUEL BUTLER'S PREFACE</h3>

<p>The Art of Needlework dates from the earliest record of the
world's history, and has, also, from time immemorial been the
support, comfort, or employment of women of every rank and age. Day
by day, it increases its votaries, who enlarge and develop its
various branches, so that any addition and assistance in teaching
or learning Needlework will be welcomed by the Daughters of
England, "wise of heart," who work diligently with their hands.</p>

<p>The recent introduction of Point Lace has brought a finer, and,
apparently, more difficult class of fancy work into general favour.
Ladies may now, however, confidently commence, with our patterns
before them, to reproduce Antique laces; for care and patience,
with a knowledge of Point Lace stitches, are alone required to
perfect the beautiful work, which, as shown in existing specimens
of exquisite Old Lace, constitute the chief glory of women's
refined industry in past centuries.</p>

<p><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b> in <b>TATTING</b>, in <b>EMBROIDERY</b>, in
<b>CROCHET</b>, in <b>KNITTING</b> and <b>NETTING</b>, in <b>BERLIN
WOOL WORK</b>, in <b>POINT LACE</b>, and <b>GUIPURE D'ART</b> are
prefixed to the pages devoted to these separate branches of
needlework. The whole work is interspersed with coloured and other
Patterns in Point Lace, Guipure d'Art, Tatting, Embroidery, and
Designs for Monograms and Initials for marking handkerchiefs and
table-linen. The quantity of materials required for each class of
work is also given with every pattern.</p>

<p>The idea of combining a series of minute and exact instructions
in fancy needlework with useful patterns was conceived some years
ago by one whose life was devoted to the inculcation of the
practical duties of woman's life, and to assisting her sex in their
daily work of <b>HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT</b> and
<b>REFINEMENT</b>.</p>

<p>Her great wish was that her <b>BOOK OF NEEDLEWORK</b> should be
as valuable in its way to her Countrywomen as her work upon
Household Management was useful in showing the best mode of
providing for the diurnal wants of families. Other hands have
brought to a conclusion her original plans. The best attainable
workers have contributed to this volume. Only those who knew the
extent of the late Mrs. Beeton's design, will miss, in the pages
now before them, "the touch of a vanished hand."</p>

<h3>TATTING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<center><a name="image_a"><img alt="Tatting Shuttle." src=
"images/imagea.jpg"></a></center>

<p>The needlework called Tatting in England,
<em>Frivolit&eacute;</em> in French, and <em>Frivolit&auml;ten</em>
in German, is a work which seems, from all accounts, to have been
in favour several generations ago. Modern ingenuity has discovered
some ways of improving on the original plan of tatting, which was,
indeed, rather a primitive sort of business as first practised. To
Mrs. Mee, one of our most accomplished <em>artistes</em> in all
matters connected with the work-table, belongs, we believe, the
introduction of the plan of working from the reel instead of the
shuttle. By this alteration the advantage of the shuttle being
constantly kept filled with cotton was gained, and the necessity
also obviated for frequently <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_ii" id="page_ii">[ii]</a></span> joining the thread; and to
Mdlle. Riego, equally distinguished in all details appertaining to
the employment of the needle, ladies are indebted for an
arrangement by which the same thread used in the making of the
pattern is used for fastening the work. The old plan only provided
for the working of the different portions which constituted the
pattern, and then these portions had to be sewn together with a
needle and thread. The ingenious workers on the Continent have also
given much attention of late to the art of tatting, and our
instructions now printed comprise what we consider the best mode of
learning and doing this exceedingly interesting and fashionable
work.</p>

<center><a name="image_b"><img alt="Tatting pin" src=
"images/imageb.jpg" width="326" height="199"></a></center>

<p>Tatting differs entirely from crochet, and is composed of
stitches forming <em>knots</em>. It is intended as an imitation of
point lace, and is especially used for trimming under-linen, on
account of its strength.</p>

<p>To make the stitches or knots a small instrument is used, called
a <em>shuttle</em>. This shuttle consists of two oval pieces, flat
on one side and convex on the other, and is made of wood or
ivory.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_iii" id=
"page_iii">[iii]</a></span>

<p>The two oval pieces are joined together by a strong cross-piece.
The illustration shows the construction of the shuttle. These
shuttles are made in ivory, pearl, tortoiseshell inlaid with pearl,
and silver; they are also manufactured in coloured bone, black,
red, and white. The best to work with are the pearl for a white
shuttle, and the inlaid tortoiseshell for a black shuttle; the
prices vary from sixpence to one shilling and two-and-sixpence
each. In selecting a shuttle be careful to see that the ends close,
as if dropped it soon becomes unthreaded, which is very
inconvenient. The cotton intended for the work is wound round this
shuttle, and the thickness of the cotton varies according to the
style of work. It is better to use the proper tatting cotton,
because it is stronger than the ordinary kinds; this is
manufactured by Messrs. Walter Evans and Co. for the purpose. Their
Boar's Head Cotton is also frequently used, and answers very
well.</p>

<br>
<p><em>Shuttles.</em></p>

<p>These are made in 3 sizes:--Finest, No. 1; No. 2, useful medium
size; No. 3, the largest.</p>

<br>
<p><em>The Way to Hold the Hands.</em></p>

<p>Take the shuttle in the right hand, between the thumb and second
finger, and allow the forefinger to remain at liberty, and rest the
under part of the shuttle <em>between</em> the second and third and
<em>on</em> the middle finger. Place the thread round the three
middle fingers of the left hand, so as to form a loop, keeping the
second and third fingers a little apart, and bring the cotton again
between the thumb and forefinger, letting the end fall within the
palm of the hand, while the end of cotton which holds on to the
shuttle passes over the thumb-nail.</p>

<br>
<p><em>To Make a Stitch.</em></p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_iv" id=
"page_iv">[iv]</a></span>

<p>Keep the hands in the position above described; pass the shuttle
at the back, through the loop--that is, between the second and
third fingers. Take the end of the shuttle which comes out from the
loop between the forefinger and thumb of the right hand, and strain
the cotton very tightly towards the right. When the cotton is drawn
through the loop, this cotton must not be impeded by the fourth
finger; it should, on the contrary, slide over it, and be drawn
tight. It should divide the loop into two parts. After this
withdraw the second left-hand finger, which is <em>above</em> the
cotton, and pass it again under that cotton, so as to draw up the
loop. A <em>half-stitch</em> is thus formed, and must be tightened
by being drawn closely to the forefinger and thumb of the left
hand. For the remaining half of the stitch keep the hands in the
same position, but, instead of letting the cotton fall over the
thumb, pass this cotton over the back of the hand; then let the
shuttle fall between the second and third fingers of the left hand,
in front, and take it out again at the back, strain the cotton very
tightly, withdraw the second finger from the loop, letting the
cotton which is behind the hand sweep over the fingers. When this
is done, guide with the unoccupied fingers of the left hand this
second half-stitch up to the other, thus completing <em>one
stitch</em>.</p>

<br>
<p><em>The Way to Make a Loop in Tatting.</em></p>

<p>When a certain number of stitches are made, very tightly draw in
the loop by straining the cotton until the first stitch touches the
last, and thus a loop is formed. During this process the stitches
should be held tightly between the forefinger and thumb.</p>

<br>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page_v" id="page_v">[v]</a></span>

<p><em>The Way to Make a Purl.</em></p>

<p>A <em>purl</em> is a small loop of cotton often used as an
edging in tatting, as, for instance, round the outer edge of the
ovals in tatted insertion No. 2. The following is the easiest
method of making a purl:--The stitches are not made quite closely
together at the place where a purl is to be made; about one-sixth
of an inch is left between each. This space is left free until the
loop is made by uniting the stitches; then the small piece of
cotton in the space bulges out between the stitches, and forms the
purl. If several are required a small space is left between every
two or three stitches, according to the desired number. Care must
be taken in that case that the small pieces of cotton left be all
of the same length, so that the purl may be perfectly even. The
purl can also be made thus: At the same time with the end of thread
take the tatting-pin or a very large darning needle or knitting
needle in the left hand, so that the point may come out farther
than the row of stitches; if then you wish to make a purl, throw
the cotton on the pin before making the stitch; then fasten this
stitch, and push it at once close to the preceding; the pin with
the cotton should come above the stitches. Do not take out the pin
before all the purl and all the stitches are completed and joined
together.</p>

<br>
<p><em>Joining the Work.</em></p>

<p>Place the tatting-pin in the loop that is to be joined, and with
the hook draw the thread of the loop--that is, round the hand
through it--pass the shuttle through this loop, and draw it up
tightly close to the stitches.</p>

<p>A "straight" or double thread is used to join various parts of
the work, and forms very beautiful patterns. Without the straight
thread we <span class="newpage"><a name="page_vi" id=
"page_vi">[vi]</a></span> should be unable to imitate point lace
patterns, or, indeed, to execute any designs but those composed of
circles, ovals, &amp;c. To use this straight thread 2 shuttles are
required; they should be of different colours. Sometimes one end of
thread is left attached to the reel instead of using the second
shuttle. In commencing a loop the straight thread is held between
the second and third fingers of the left hand, about 2 or 3 inches
from the work; the other shuttle is held as usual in the right
hand, and the stitches and purls worked with it upon the foundation
of the straight thread of the second shuttle.</p>

<p>This insertion consists of 2 rows of three-branched patterns
which lie opposite each other, and are joined by slanting rows of
knots. A coloured silk ribbon is drawn through these rows which
join the patterns. Each of the 3 branches of 1 pattern consists of
9 double, 1 purl, 9 double, and must be worked close to another.
When the 3rd branch is completed, fasten another piece of cotton on
to the middle branch. Work 12 double over this 2nd piece of cotton,
and then work without the 2nd piece of cotton a 2nd three-branched
pattern like the 1st.* Fasten the 2nd piece of cotton on to the
middle branch of the just-finished pattern, work 12 double over it,
then again a three-branched pattern; in this pattern as well as in
the following ones, instead of working the <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_11" id="page_11">[11]</a></span> purl of the 1st branch,

<p>Work first 8 ovals, each composed of 5 double stitches, 3 purl
divided one from the other by 4 double stitches, 5 double stitches;
these ovals are joined together by the purl at the sides, then the
circle is tightened as much as possible, and the cotton with which
you are working is twisted round the ends of cotton that have been
cut: the cotton is then fastened off nearly underneath.</p>

<p>Begin a fresh small oval, composed of 12 double stitches, which
should be fastened to the preceding oval after 3 double stitches
(to the purl in the centre of the first oval), then fasten it again
to the purl which joins together the first and the second oval;
leave a space of about one-fourth of an inch, and work an oval
composed of 4 double stitches, 5 purl, followed each by 2 double
stitches, 4 double stitches. A very little farther <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">[12]</a></span> off make a
very small oval, composed of 8 double stitches, which after the
four first double stitches is joined to the centre purl of the
second oval, leaving the same space between as before, make another
oval of 4 double stitches, 5 purl, each followed by 2 double
stitches, 4 double stitches; but the first purl is <em>missed</em>,
because at this place the oval is joined to the fifth purl of the
corresponding oval; once more leave a space of one-fourth of an
inch, and repeat. At the end of the round the two ends of cotton
are tied tightly together.</p>

<p>This border, edged with beads No. 4, is worked in middling-size
purse silk over fine silk cord of the same colour as the silk.
Before beginning to work this pattern, thread the beads which take
the place of purl stitches, and which are slipped in between two
double stitches. When the row of stitches is of the length
required, form the trefoil leaves, and sew a few beads over the
places where they are joined. These trefoil leaves are made
separately, and then sewn together.</p>

<p>This lace is rendered stronger by the crochet rows of scallops
and treble stitch round the edge. Begin with the tatting as
follows: Make a circle of 8 double, 7 purl divided by 2 double, 8
double. This circle is repeated at a distance of about
three-fourths of an inch, only instead of the 1st purl each
following circle must be fastened on to the last purl of the
preceding circle. Then take some crochet cotton, which must be
finer than the cotton used for tatting, and work a row of double
stitches over the thread which joins the circles. The number of
stitches depends on the length and size of the cotton; work double
stitches round the circles at the place where both ends meet. The
outer row consists of treble stitches, which are worked with 1
chain stitch between, missing 1 stitch under each chain. The
scallops consist of the two following <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_15" id="page_15">[15]</a></span> rows:--1 double, with
which the last and first purl of 2 circles are joined, 4 chain; in
each of the other purl, 1 double, 4 chain, between 2 double
stitches.</p>

"page_21">[21]</a></span> of 3 branched figures turned opposite one
another, which are worked separately and then joined into a row.
Work 9 times as follows:--2 double, 1 purl, 2 double, * draw into a
circle and * work at a short distance a 2nd circle as follows:--2
double fastened on to the last purl of the 1st circle, 8 times 2
double, 1 purl, 2 double, repeat once more from *, knot together
the two ends of the cotton, and fasten them on the wrong side. One
figure is thus completed; each following figure is fastened on to
the preceding one on the middle purl of a circle (see
illustration). When a sufficient number of such figures have been
worked, work a 2nd row of them in the same manner, and fasten from
illustration each middle circle of one figure on to the
corresponding circle of the 1st row. The circles filled with lace
stitch are worked when the 2 rows are completed from illustration
in the empty places between 4 patterns; work first 3 double, fasten
them on to a purl on the side of a leaf turned inside, * 3 double,
fasten them on to a purl of the next leaf, repeat 5 times more from
*, work 3 double, join the stitches into a circle, but not too
close, so that the purls keep their natural position; cut off the
cotton, and fasten the two ends on the wrong side. The lace stitch
inside of these circles is worked with fine crochet cotton; the
pattern may be changed for a single or double wheel.</p>

<p>24.--<em>Insertion in Tatting.</em></p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 30;
tatting-pin No. 3.</p>

<p>Begin by working separately a sufficient number of small
rosettes, each composed of six ovals of double stitches and purl.
These ovals are worked first in a straight row, then they are
joined into a circle and united in the centre by button-hole
stitches. The rosettes are joined together with fine cotton. The
crochet border is then worked on either <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_22" id="page_22">[22]</a></span> side in chain stitches
and treble crochet, as seen in illustration.</p>

<p>25.--<em>Centre of a Tatted Couvrette</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 20,
or crochet cotton No. 1; tatting-pin No. 2.</p>

<p>This illustration shows the centre of a tatted couvrette in full
size, and measuring 12 inches across. Separate rosettes like the
pattern may be joined together with smaller ones, and form a very
pretty couvrette. The pattern is worked in rounds. Begin the
rosette with a circle, consisting of 4 double, 1 purl, 6 double, 1
purl, 6 double, 1 purl, 4 double. Take up another shuttle, and work
over the cotton on it, fasten the end on the last double of the
circle and work over it, beginning close to the circle, 6 plain, 1
circle like the 1st worked with the 1st shuttle, and which is
fastened on the last purl of the 1st circle at the place of the 1st
purl; 6 plain, and continue to work so alternately till you have 7
circles divided by 6 plain stitches. Draw up very tightly the
cotton over which you work, so that the circles form a rosette,
which is closed by sewing together the two corresponding purl of
the first and <span class="newpage"><a name="page_23" id=
"page_23">[23]</a></span> last circle. Both the ends of the cotton
over which you have worked are knotted together. For the 2nd round,
fasten the cotton on one shuttle on the middle purl of a circle,
work a circle like those of the 1st round, take up the 2nd shuttle,
and work on exactly as in the 1st round, only work 8 plain between
the circles over the cotton on the 2nd shuttle. The 2nd round
consists of 15 circles; the cotton with which you work must be
fastened at the required places on the middle purl of a circle of
the preceding round. The 3rd and following rounds are worked in the
same manner; the number of circles must be such as to keep the
couvrette quite flat. In the pattern the 3rd round has 26 circles.
Fasten the cotton well after each round.</p>

<center><a name="image_26"><img alt="Tatted Lace." src=
"images/image026.jpg" width="481" height="133"></a></center>

<p>This very simple lace consists of scallops which look as if they
were slightly gathered. It must be worked with tatting cotton. Each
scallop consists of 5 plain, 1 purl, 5 plain, then alternately 5
purled stitches, draw up these stitches till the cotton between the
1st and last stitch is two-fifths of an inch long, and work a 2nd
similar scallop at a short distance from the 1st. But in the
following scallops fasten each to the last purl of the preceding
scallop instead of working the 1st purl.</p>

<center><a name="image_27"><img alt="Tatted Lace." src=
"images/image027.jpg" width="351" height="215"></a></center>

<p>This pretty lace is worked with fine tatting cotton. Work with 2
threads; the knots are worked over the cotton, which is held in the
right hand. Work first the outer scallops of the lace.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_25" id=
"page_25">[25]</a></span>

<p>Fasten both ends of cotton together and make 10 double, divided
by 1 purl, turn the work so as to turn the wrong side upwards,
fasten the cotton over which you work on to the last purl, go back
over the same row, miss 1 purl next to the cotton with which you
work, 9 double divided by 1 purl, fastening the cotton over which
you work on the next purl of the 1st row after every double stitch.
This forms 1 scallop. * Turn the work downwards (that is, the purl
stitch must be turned downwards), make 4 times 2 double, 1 purl, 1
purled stitch: this is the straight row between 2 outer scallops of
the lace. Then work a scallop like the preceding one, fastening it
from illustration after the first row on the middle one of the 9
outer purl of the preceding scallop, with the cotton over which you
work; repeat from * till the lace is long enough, and fasten the
cotton. Knot both ends together again, fasten the cotton over which
you work on the first purl of the first scallop, make 9 double, 1
short purl, 1 double, turn so that the upper edge of the row is
turned downwards, and the scallops upwards, 5 double, fasten the 2
middle purl of the 4 of the next straight row together by drawing
the cotton, with which you are working through the 2nd purl, so as
to form a loop, draw the cotton over which you work through this
loop and draw up the latter; work 5 double, fasten the cotton over
which you work on to the short purl worked after 9 double, turn the
work so that the outer scallops of the lace are turned downwards,
10 double, fasten the cotton over which you work on the first purl
of the next scallop, repeat from *, and fasten the cotton. After
having fastened both ends together again, turn the work the right
side upwards and the outer scallops upwards also, fasten the cotton
over which you work on to the short purl which is under the first
loop; * work 4 times 2 double, 1 purl, 2 <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_26" id="page_26">[26]</a></span> double, fasten the
cotton over which you work on the purl under the next loop, and
repeat from * till the lace is completed.</p>

<p>28.--<em>Collar in Tatting and Darned Netting</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40;
tatting-pin No. 3; Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s French embroidery
cotton No. 60; square netting.</p>

<center><a name="image_28"><img alt=
"Collar in Tatting and Darned Netting" src="images/image028.jpg"
width="462" height="297"></a></center>

<p>The pattern is worked with very fine cotton; the netted
grounding over a mesh measuring two-fifths of an inch round. The
collar is ornamented round the outer edge with a tatted lace. Work
a straight strip of netting for the grounding; begin with 2
stitches, work 18 rows backwards and forwards, increasing 1 at the
end of each row, so that the last row has 19 holes; work 1 row
without increasing; then continue to work with the same number of
stitches, increasing 1 at the end of one row and decreasing 1 at
the end of the other. When the strip is sufficiently <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">[27]</a></span> long, work
1 row again without increasing or decreasing, and form the side by
making 18 rows, decreasing 1 stitch at the end of each, cast off
the 2 last stitches on 1 stitch without forming a new stitch on the
needle. Trace the outline of the collar on the grounding with thick
cotton, and begin to darn it from illustration. When the darning is
completed work the tatted lace with the same cotton, as follows:--6
double, 1 short purl, alternately, 3 times 3 double, 1 purl, 6
double, draw up the stitch so as to form a scallop leaving
one-fifth of an inch between the first and last stitch; work a
second scallop at a short distance from the first, and so on; every
scallop is fastened on to the preceding one after the first 3
double stitches. Work a row of double overcast stitch between the
darned netting and the tatted lace; work this row over the cotton
tracing, marking the outline of the collar on the grounding and
over the cotton between the tatted scallops. Work also a row of
double overcast round the neck part, gathering in the collar a
little if necessary. Cut away the netting on the wrong side close
to the row of overcast stitches.</p>

<center><a name="image_29"><img alt="Mignardise and Tatting." src=
"images/image029.jpg" width="268" height="292"></a></center>

<p>Patterns formed of mignardise and tatting are of quite new
style, and look very pretty. The insertion is easy to work by the
following process:--Make first a circle, as follows: 1 plain
stitch, 2 double, 1 purl, 6 double, 1 purl, 2 double, 1 plain;
fasten the cotton on to one side of the mignardise, at the distance
of about five-eighths of an <span class="newpage"><a name="page_28"
id="page_28">[28]</a></span> inch, by taking 2 loops of it
together; work a second circle at a short distance from the first,
and so on. When the strip of insertion is sufficiently long, work
in the same manner on the other side of the mignardise. This kind
of work is destined to become very popular, and nothing can be more
light and graceful than the union of mignardise and tatting.</p>

<center><a name="image_30"><img alt="Linen Bag for Cotton." src=
"images/image030.jpg" width="312" height="247"></a></center>

<p>The bag seen in illustration No. 30 is meant to keep the cotton
for working a couvrette; it consists of a round piece, measuring 6
inches across, which is hemmed all round, and trimmed with a tatted
lace. It is drawn together at top.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s cotton No. 30.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_29" id=
"page_29">[29]</a></span>

<p>The insertion shown in illustration No. 31 is composed in two
similar halves. Begin the first in the following way:--10 double, 1
purl, 3 double, 1 purl, 10 double, join the stitches into a circle,
and work a second similar circle at a distance of one-third of an
inch; instead of the 1st purl, draw the cotton through the 2nd purl
of the first-worked circle; leave an interval of one-eighth of an
inch, and repeat the two rounds till the insertion is sufficiently
long. Then tat round the pieces of cotton which join the two
rounds, work round the longest 10 double, and round the shortest 4
double, inserting the shuttle alternately once upwards and once
downwards, but for the rest proceeding as in the common button-hole
stitch. When the first half is completed, work the second in the
same way, and fasten it on to the first with the purl.</p>

"images/image032.jpg" width="314" height="213"></a></center>

<p>The pretty effect of the insertion shown in illustration No. 32
is obtained by means of longer and shorter purl. Work as
follows:--Join 9 double into a circle, 1 long purl, 3 double, 1
long purl, 4 double *. <span class="newpage"><a name="page_30" id=
"page_30">[30]</a></span> After an interval of five-eighths of an
inch, begin the large figure of the pattern: 2 double, 1 small
purl, 2 double, draw the cotton through the last purl of the small
circle, 2 double, drawn through the 1st purl of the same circle, 2
double, 1 small purl, 2 double, 1 long purl, 2 double, 1 small
purl, 2 double, repeat 6 times more from *, and draw up. After an
interval of five-eighths of an inch comes another small circle: 4
double, draw the cotton through the last purl of the large figure,
3 double, draw the cotton through the next long purl of the same
figure, 2 double, 1 long purl, 3 double, 1 long purl, 4 double.
Repeat the pattern for the length of insertion required. The
threads which join the small circles are worked over with 7 double
in the manner described above, only the cotton at the principal
figure must be left loose the width of a straw, so as to imitate a
long purl. Complete the insertion from illustration by tatting
round the small circles of 16 double on the other side (but in the
contrary direction), form no purl, but draw the cotton through the
long purl of the large figure; the threads which join the 2 circles
are likewise drawn through the middle long purl of the large
figure; this thread is then tatted over with 7 double, like the
opposite outer edge.</p>

<p>The square is composed first of nine 4-branched patterns, worked
in 3 rows of 3 patterns each, and joined on one to the other with
purl. Each pattern consists of 4 branches close to each other, and
each branch consists of 7 double, 1 purl, 7 double; when the 4
branches of one <span class="newpage"><a name="page_31" id=
"page_31">[31]</a></span> pattern are completed, cut off the
cotton, and fasten both ends together so as to form a small circle
in the centre. Then work a second pattern, which is fastened on to
the first and second branches of the first pattern, instead of
working the purl stitch; work a third pattern, which is fastened in
the same manner on to the second pattern. Then work 2 more rows
exactly the same as can be seen in illustration.</p>

<center><a name="image_33"><img alt="Tatted Square." src=

purl of the first pattern, work 4 double, 13 purl divided by 2
double, 4 double, draw up the stitches close, fasten the cotton
again on to the same purl of the first pattern *, and work the
following scallop at a short distance:--4 double fastened on the
last purl of the preceding circle, 10 purl divided by 2 double, 4
double, draw up the stitch, leaving an interval of two-fifths of an
inch between the first and the last; fasten the cotton on to the

<p>This diamond is suitable for trimming collars, cuffs, &amp;c.,
when worked with fine cotton. Work first the four corner patterns
separately, as <span class="newpage"><a name="page_34" id=
"page_34">[34]</a></span> follows:--7 double, 3 purl divided by 3
double, 6 double, join the stitches into a circle, work close to
this circle a second one consisting of 6 double fastened on the
last purl of the 1st circle, 4 double, 2 purl divided by 4 double,
6 double; then a 3rd circle consisting of 6 double fastened on the
last purl of the preceding circle, 3 double, 2 purl divided by 3
double, 7 double. Take a second shuttle, fasten the cotton on the
end of the cotton of the 1st circle, throw the cotton of the 1st
shuttle over the fingers of the left hand, and work with this
cotton over the cotton on the other shuttle in the right hand. Work
5 double, and then one circle as follows with the cotton in the
left hand only:--8 double fastened on the last purl of the 3rd of
the 3 circles worked close to each other, 5 double, 1 purl, 5
double, 1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 6 double, then again over the
cotton on the other shuttle, 5 double, 4 purl divided by 5 double,
5 double, then with one shuttle only one circle as follows:--6
double, 1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 5 double, 1 purl, 5 double
fastened on 1st purl of the circle worked at the beginning, 8
double; then again with two shuttles 5 double. Fasten the cotton on
the piece of cotton before the 5 double worked with two shuttles,
so that the stitches worked over two shuttles form a circle, and
cut off the cotton. When three of these patterns have been worked,
work the centre pattern of the square. It consists of 4 leaves
touching each other at the lower points; each leaf is formed of 3
double, 5 purl divided by 3 double, 3 double; each following leaf
is fastened on to the preceding one at the place of the 1st purl.
Then work first 1 round of the oval circles of the square, with
which the corner patterns are joined. Fasten the cotton on one purl
of one corner pattern, make 7 double, 1 purl, 8 double; fasten on
the corresponding purl of another corner pattern, work 8 double, 1
purl, 7 double, join the stitches into a circle, fasten the cotton
on to the same purl to <span class="newpage"><a name="page_35" id=
"page_35">[35]</a></span> which the cotton has already been
fastened, carry the latter on to the next purl of the same corner
pattern, fasten it, then work three more circles like the first,
which are fastened on to each preceding circle, at the place of the
first purl; fasten the cotton on the two cross purl of the centre
pattern, and work four similar circles on the other side of the
same. The 8 circles which go across the square in the opposite
direction are worked in the same manner. When the square is
completed, draw two threads on each side of each corner pattern on
to the other side of the square along the cotton which joins the
circles together.</p>

<p>The beauty of this lace depends entirely upon the regularity of
the tatting. The purl stitches must be very regularly made, the
circles must be drawn up tight. Make * 1 circle, consisting of 4
double, 8 purl divided by 2 double, 4 double; close to this circle
a second one; 5 double fastened on the last purl of the preceding
circle, 8 times 2 <span class="newpage"><a name="page_39" id=
"page_39">[39]</a></span> double divided by 1 purl, 1 purl 5
double, close to the 2nd circle a third one similar to the first,
but instead of working the 1st purl fasten it on the last purl of
the preceding circle; leave an interval of about 1-2/5 inch, and
repeat from * till the lace is sufficiently long. The rest is
worked in crochet. Take the fine crochet cotton and work the
straight row at the top to join the patterns together. Crochet 1
double in the 3 first and last purl of the first and last circle of
one pattern, then a sufficient number of double stitches under the
piece of cotton which joins 2 circles. At the place where the
circles are drawn together, join the two pieces of cotton (the
beginning and the end) in such a manner that the top of the lace
forms a straight line (see illustration). The 2nd row consists of 1
treble in every other stitch, 1 chain after every treble. Then work
on the other side of the lace * a row of treble stitches divided by
chain. The treble stitches are worked in the purl stitches of the
circles. Work 1 long treble in the 1st purl left free of the 1st
circle (4th purl of the circle), 3 chain, * 1 treble, 3 chain, 1
treble, 3 chain, 2 treble in the next 2 purl, but cast off the 1st
treble only so far as to keep 2 loops on the needle. When the 2nd
treble is completed cast off all the loops on the needle, 3 chain,
5 treble divided by 4 chain, 3 chain, 2 treble in the 2 following
purl, which are cast off like those above described, 3 chain, 2
treble divided by 3 chain in the 2 next purl of a pattern, 1 chain,
1 long treble with which you must join the last purl and the first
one of the next pattern, 1 chain; repeat from *. The next row
consists of small scallops worked round the chain stitch scallops
of the preceding row; work in each 1 double, 4 treble, 1 double, 1
double in the first and last chain stitch of every pattern.</p>

<p>Begin the tatting with fine cotton and 2 shuttles. Work with the
cotton on one shuttle over the cotton on the other in the following
manner:--Knot the 2 ends of cotton together * 4 times 2 double
divided by a short purl, 3 long purl divided by 1 double; the 1st
and 3rd purl must be three-fifths of an inch long, the 2nd one
two-fifths of an inch; 4 times 2 double divided by a short purl, 1
purl two-fifths of an inch long; repeat from * till the strip of
insertion is sufficiently long. Then work a similar row of tatting,
and join the two rows before working the 1 long purl, by fastening
the cotton on the corresponding long purl of the 1st row, so that
the 2 rows are joined closely together, and the purl stitches of
either are turned outwards. At the top and bottom of the tatting
work the 3 following rows of crochet:--* 1 double in the middle one
of the 3 long purl, 8 chain, 1 double in each of the 3 following
long purl, 8 chain; repeat from * to the end of the row. 2nd row. 8
double in each scallop, miss the 3 double stitches of the preceding
row under 3 chain. The 3rd row consists of treble stitches in <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">[41]</a></span>
every other stitch, 1 chain after every treble. Lastly, the leaves
are worked with thick cotton by filling up the first and last long
purl of a pattern with darning stitch from illustration; the cross
stitches between the two rows of tatting are worked with very fine
cotton.</p>

<p>42.--<em>Purse in Tatting and Beads</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Grey purse-silk; steel beads; scarlet glac&eacute;
silk; a steel clasp with chain.</p>

<p>This purse is worked in tatting with grey silk and beads. The
beads are threaded on a piece of silk, with which you work over
another piece of the same. Begin each of the second halves of the
purse with the circle in the centre, which consists of 1 purled
stitch, 1 purl (all the purl of this circle are three-tenths of an
inch long, and are covered with six beads, which must be drawn up
close together before working the purl), 12 double divided by 1
purl. Join the stitches into a circle by knotting together the two
ends of the silk.</p>

<p><em>2nd round:</em> Begin again and work one of the small
circles; * 2 double, draw up one bead after each, 1 double, 1 short
purl without beads, 2 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, fasten

circle <span class="newpage"><a name="page_42" id=
"page_42">[42]</a></span> and repeat from *. Each following small
circle must be fastened on the next purl of the circle which forms
the centre; they are also fastened on to each other, instead of
working the 1st purl, by fastening the piece of silk over which you
work on the preceding small circle; in the larger circles, instead
of working the 1st purl with 4 beads, the piece <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">[43]</a></span> of silk
must be fastened on the last purl of the preceding circle, so that
it comes between the 2nd and 3rd beads. At the end of the round,
the ends of the silk are knotted together and fastened off.</p>

must come between the 2 beads; 3 double, 1 bead after each; 1
double, 1 purl with 2 beads; 3 double, with 1 bead after each; 1
double; leave a small interval, and repeat 11 times more from *,
then fasten the ends.</p>

<p>When two similar parts have been worked, line them with scarlet
glac&eacute; silk; fasten them together round the outside, and sew
on the clasp. A round of large circles edges the purse round the
outside. The 1st of these circles consists of 12 double, 1 bead
after each, 1 double, 1 purl with 2 beads, 4 double, 1 bead after
each, 1 double. Work a 2nd circle at a short distance from the 1st:
* 4 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double fastened on the purl of the
1st circle of this round; 7 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, 1
purl with 2 beads, 4 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double; leave a
short interval, and repeat from * till a sufficient number of

<p>This pattern is composed of leaves and flowers. Each of the six
leaves forming a circle is composed of 4 double, 2 purl, separated
by 2 double, 4 double (the first and last purl of each leaf must be
joined in the manner before explained), and the centre of each
circle forms a wheel. The flower has four leaves: each leaf
consists of 6 double, II purl, separated each by 1 double, and
again 6 double; each leaf is filled up with button-hole stitches in
fine cotton. To form the circle in the centre of this flower, turn
several times the thread which joins the leaves, and work
button-hole stitches round it. Join the flowers and the circles by
knotting them together, or by making 1 purl longer than the others,
and by drawing the next figure through. The crochet border on each
side of the tatting consists of six rows, which are plainly seen in
the illustration.</p>

width="563" height="391"></a></center>

<p>This mixture of tatting and lace stitch is a style of work not
only entirely new, but very pretty and effective when cotton of
very different sizes is used. The tatting is begun with a row of
circles two-thirds of an inch distant from each other; each circle
consists of 13 stitches of plain tatting. Fasten a 2nd row to the
1st, and a 3rd to the 2nd, by working a circle of 13 stitches of
plain tatting at one-third of an inch distance, * then at the same
distance; fasten the cotton on the next circle of the preceding
row, work a circle at the same distance again, and repeat from *.
The cotton is fastened on the circles by drawing it through the
circle with a crochet-needle, so as to form a loop, and then
drawing it out of the loop. Take care to keep the distance between
2 circles always the same. Between the circles of the 3rd row draw
another piece of cotton, by fastening the cotton on each <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">[46]</a></span>
circle of the 3rd row at distances of two-thirds of an inch. Then
work the lower edge of the border in the following way:--1 small
spot called a <em>Josephine knot</em> (for which work 5 stitches of
plain tatting, draw the cotton downwards through the loop which
fastens the stitches, and draw up the whole), fasten the cotton
between the next two circles of the 3rd row, * and a little further
make a spot consisting of 8 stitches of single tatting, close to
this a circle formed of 3 double, 9 purl divided by 2 double, 3
double; then again a spot of 8 stitches of plain tatting, turn the
2 last spots so as to make their round sides come opposite one
another; fasten the cotton on again between the 2 next circles of
the 3rd row. Then a little further off work 1 small spot (5
stitches of plain tatting), 1 circle of 3 double, 1 purl, 2 double
fastened on the last purl of the preceding circle, 2 double, 5 purl
divided by 2 double, 3 double; then again a small spot (5 plain
stitches), fasten the cotton on again between the next 2 circles of
the 3rd row, and repeat from *, always fastening each new circle to
the corresponding purl of the preceding one. On the other long
side, the border is completed by 2 rows of crochet. The 1st row is
formed by working 1 double under the piece of cotton between 2
circles of the 1st row, with 5 chain stitches between.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> 1 treble in every other stitch, 1 chain stitch
after every treble. The strip of insertion is then tacked on a
piece of cardboard or oil-cloth, and the lace stitches are worked
between the circles, as is seen in illustration.</p>

<p>45.--<em>Tatted Rosette.</em></p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 30
for large rosette, No. 80 for small rosette; tatting-pin No. 3.</p>

<p>This rosette forms a very pretty trimming for lingerie--cravats,
caps, <span class="newpage"><a name="page_47" id=
"page_47">[47]</a></span> handkerchiefs, &amp;c. The raised pattern
in the centre consists of 4 rounds, consisting of 5 circles each,
which are sewn together and then fastened on the rosette. The 5
circles of each round must be worked close to each other: after
working the last circle of each round, knot the beginning and end
of the cotton together. Each circle of the smallest round has 9
double, the circles of the next round each 15, the circles of the
following one 21, and the circles of the last and largest round 27
double stitches. When these circles have been sewn on one to
another as in illustration, work a large circle consisting of 4
double, 1 purl, 9 times alternately 5 double, 1 purl, then 1
double. The purls of this circle are fastened on to the circles of
the next round of the rosette. Fasten the cotton on to the next
purl of the middle circle, and work a circle as follows:--4 double,
1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 3 double, 1 purl, 3 double, 1 purl, 4
double, 1 purl, 4 double. Repeat 9 times more from *, but now,
instead of working the 1st purl of every circle, fasten it on to
the last purl of the preceding circle. Then fasten the cotton. For
the last round, which consists of scallops and rounds, fasten the
cotton on to the middle purl of a circle of the preceding round,
and work a circle consisting of 3 times alternately 4 double, 1
purl, then 4 double.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_48" id=
"page_48">[48]</a></span>

<center><a name="image_45"><img alt="Tatted Rosette." src=

<p>Then fasten a second thread on to the same purl on which the
just completed circle has been fastened, and over which all the
scallops are to be worked. Work over it 5 double, fastened on to
the last purl of the preceding circle, 4 double, 1 purl, 4 double,
1 purl, 5 double. Fasten the cotton on to the middle purl of the
next circle of the preceding round, and repeat from * till the
round is completed; but in working these circles, instead of the
first purl, fasten them on to the last purl of the preceding
scallop. Lastly, the raised pattern is sewn on.</p>

<p>Begin this elegant border with 2 rows of tatting, in the
following manner:--</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> 2 double, 1 purl, 3 double, 1 purl, 3 double,
1 purl, 2 double; draw these stitches up into a circle, and repeat
the circle at a very short distance, till the border is long
enough; but instead of working the first purl of each circle, you
must join the circle to the preceding one; the purl on the sides of
the circle must therefore be longer than that in the middle.</p>

<p>For the 2nd row take another shuttle, make a loop on the left
side with the cotton, and work with this end of cotton over the
cotton in the right hand, which is also to be held between the
thumb and forefinger of the left hand. Then work in the following
way:--2 double, then 1 circle consisting of 3 double, 1 purl, 3
double; to form this circle, let the cotton in the left-hand
shuttle fall downwards, and make a loop round the left hand with
the cotton on the shuttle of the right hand. Then take up again the
left-hand shuttle, and join the circle to the middle purl of the
1st circle of the 1st row by drawing the cotton through the <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">[50]</a></span> purl
like a loop, and then drawing the cotton in the right hand through
this loop. * 7 double, 1 circle, 7 double, joined to the middle
purl of the next circle of the 1st row; 1 circle, 5 double, 1
circle joined on the middle purl of the following circle; repeat
from *.</p>

<p>The upper edge of the border is worked in 2 crochet rows, in the
following manner:--</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> * 2 treble, divided by 1 chain in the 1st
circle of the 1st row of tatting; 2 chain; repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> * 1 treble in the 1st chain of the preceding
row, 1 purl (3 chain, 1 slip stitch in the 1st), miss 1 stitch of
the preceding row under it; repeat from *.</p>

<p>Materials for trimmings: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s knitting
cotton No. 20; tatting cotton No. 50; tatting-pin No. 3. For
couvrettes, crochet cotton No. 4.</p>

<p>This rosette, joined to other similar ones, forms a very pretty
trimming for articles of fine linen, or even for small couvrettes;
if used for the former, they must be worked with very fine cotton.
The centre of the rosette is formed of an embroidered raised
pattern worked in <em>point de minute</em>; round this centre there
are small circles worked in button-hole stitch; the embroidery is
worked with knitting cotton, the circles with crochet cotton.
Before beginning the circles, make a circle consisting of a
foundation chain of 80 stitches, in order to be able to fasten the
button-hole stitch; in each of the stitches of the foundation chain
work 1 double, then fasten the cotton. In the 2nd round of these
circles fasten the cotton on every 5th stitch of the crochet
circle. Work 1 round of open-work treble stitch in the double
stitch of the crochet circle, work in tatting the border of the
rosette as follows in 1 <span class="newpage"><a name="page_51" id=
"page_51">[51]</a></span> round:--* 2 double, 1 purl, 2 double,
fastened on to 1 chain stitch between 2 treble stitch, 2 double; 1
purl, 2 double,; join these stitches into a circle; turn the work
so that the wrong side lies upwards, and work a second larger
circle at a short distance consisting of 4 double, 5 purl divided
by 2 double, 4 double, turn again and repeat from *. The smaller
circles must be fastened after every other treble stitch; the
larger and smaller circles must be fastened above one another at
the place of the 1st purl.</p>

width="405" height="429"></a></center>

<p>The diamond pattern placed in the corner of the collar is
commenced in the centre. For each of the four centre leaves work 6
double stitches, 6 purl divided one from the other by 3 double
stitches, then 6 more double stitches. Fasten off the cotton, cut
it, and begin a fresh leaf <span class="newpage"><a name="page__53"
id="page__53">[53]</a></span> by working 2 double stitches, 10 purl
divided one from the other by 2 double stitches, then 2 more double
stitches. (This small leaf forms one of the corners of the diamond
pattern.) Fasten the cotton to the fourth purl of one of the four
centre leaves, and work another leaf similar to the preceding. Join
this leaf by its two centre purl to the two last purl of the corner
leaf (see illustration). After two more similar leaves, work one
corner leaf, and continue the pattern in the same manner until you
come back to the first corner leaf, then fasten off, and cut the
cotton. Place the diamond pattern upon the point of the collar, and
cut away the material under it; fold back the edges, sew them
neatly, and cover them with the following crochet edging:--Make
alternately 2 chain, 1 purl (the latter composed of 3 chain joined
together by 1 slip stitch). It will be easy to work the circles in
tatting from our illustration; they form an elegant border round
the collar. We shall merely say that the centre circle is always
worked separately, and that the cotton is fastened on afresh to
work the eight outer leaves. The upper edge of this border is
worked in crochet. It is composed of two rows--one formed of chain
stitches, and a few slip stitches worked in the purl of the circles
in tatting, the other worked in open treble crochet.</p>

<p>52.--<em>Border in Crochet and Tatting</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s Boar's Head cotton No.

<center><a name="image_052"><img alt=
"Border in Crochet and Tatting." src="images/image052.jpg" width=
"387" height="319"></a></center>

<p>This border is formed of circles in tatting and crochet leaves,
which are joined together by rows of crochet work; a narrow <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">[58]</a></span>
border in tatting forms the lower edge. Omitting this edge, the
border forms a strip of insertion. Each of the rosettes or circles
is begun in the centre; work first 2 double (a double stitch is
formed by passing the thread over the back of the hand, and then
passing the shuttle upwards between the forefinger and second
finger, and drawing it up, then work a stitch of plain tatting;
this completes the double stitch, and whenever so many double
stitches are directed it means the 2 stitches), 1 purl, repeat 9
times, join the stitch into a circle, work at a small distance * a
smaller ring consisting of 3 double, 5 purl, divided each by 2
double stitches, 4 double, draw the cotton through the purl of the
first circle, and repeat 8 times more from *, only each following
circle must be fastened on to a purl of the preceding circle <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">[59]</a></span>
after 3 double stitches, and having completed each circle the
thread must be drawn through the purl of the first circle, which
forms the centre of the rosette. The beginning and the end of the
thread are knotted together. For the tatted border, make at short
distances 1 loop with 5 double, 1 purl, 5 double; after having
worked a sufficient number of such loops, wind another thread round
the thread between the loops, turning always 1 loop on the right
side and 1 on the left. Now begin the crochet part with the leaves.
Make for each of these a foundation chain of 12 stitches, crochet
back over this chain 2 double in the last stitch but one, 1 double
in the next stitch, 1 treble in each of the following 7 chain, 2
treble in the next stitch, 2 treble, 1 long treble, and 2 treble in
the next following stitch of the foundation chain. Work on the
other side of the chain the same pattern, only the reverse way;
then 3 double in the point of the leaf thus formed, and edge the
whole leaf with a round of double stitches, always working 2 double
in each stitch of the preceding row, and 3 in the long treble
stitch. In working this last round, the circles must be joined to
the leaves by taking up the purl stitch of the circle before
casting off the corresponding double stitch of the leaf; then work
the stem which joins the 2 rows of circles and leaves with a row of
chain stitches, on which a row of double is worked. Then comes the
border which forms the upper edge. Make a row of chain stitches,
joining leaves and circles together, then work 3 rows of treble,
work 3 more rows over the tatted border, the first row entirely in
chain stitches, after every fourth stitch take up the purl of the
loops on one side. 2nd row: 1 treble in the middle stitch of the 3
chain, 2 treble, divided by 3 chain. 3rd row: 1 treble, 1 chain,
miss 1 under the last. In the last row the leaves and circles must
be fastened on the border, as seen in illustration.</p>

<p>54.--<em>Linen Collar trimmed with Tatting</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No.
100, tatting-pin No. 3; 1 piece of very fine cord.</p>

<p>This collar is ornamented with a triangle and a border of a very
effective pattern. The triangle is begun in the centre, by working
for each of the three leaves 5 double stitches, 5 purl divided one
from the other by 2 double stitches, and 5 more double stitches.
When the third leaf is completed, fasten off and cut the cotton.
Now take, instead of the cotton wound upon the shuttle, a piece of
extremely fine cord, over which work with the cotton from the reel
the following row of stitches:--1 double stitch, fasten the cotton
to the centre purl of one of the three leaves, * 2 double stitches,
5 purl divided one from the other by 2 double stitches, 3 double
stitches, fasten the cotton to the centre purl of the nearest leaf,
2 double stitches, 9 purl divided one from the other by 3 double
stitches, 2 double stitches fastened to the same purl as before.
Repeat from * twice more, then fasten off, and cut the cord and the
cotton. Begin afresh, and work 3 small circles, each composed of 12
plain stitches placed quite close together (these form <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">[63]</a></span> one of the
corners of the triangle), then at small distances one from the
other work 13 similar circles, every second one of which is
fastened to one purl of the row of <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_64" id="page_64">[64]</a></span> stitches worked over the
cord (see illustration). Cut away from the collar the piece of
linen which is to be replaced by the triangle, fold in the edges
and work them round in button-hole stitch, and fill up the space
with the triangle. For the border, work first * one circle composed
of 3 double stitches, 4 purl divided one from the other by 2 double
stitches, 3 more double stitches; take up the cord once more and
work over it, 3 double stitches, then, without cord, 1 circle
composed of 2 double stitches, 12 purl divided one from the other
by 2 double stitches, 2 more double stitches; take up the cord
again and work over it 3 double stitches, 4 purl divided each by 2
double stitches, 3 double stitches. Fasten the cotton to the third
purl (reckoning from the last) of the second circle worked without
cord; 3 double stitches fastened to the fourth purl of the row of
stitches worked over the cord (see illustration), 2 double
stitches, 6 purl divided each by 2 double stitches, 3 double
stitches fastened to the purl of next circle, 3 double stitches
fastened to the last purl of the row, 2 double stitches, 3 purl
divided each by 2 double stitches, 3 double stitches; fasten the
cotton to the sixth purl of the circle (reckoning from the
beginning), 4 double stitches. Repeat from *. Work over the top of
the border a crochet edging similar to that round the diamond
pattern of collar No. 49. For the point of the border, at the
corner of the collar, see illustration No. 54.</p>

<p>This collar is worked with very fine tatting cotton. It consists
of four branched tatted patterns and of separate tatted circles,
fastened on to one another as seen in illustration. The four
branched patterns are <span class="newpage"><a name="page_65" id=
"page_65">[65]</a></span> worked as follow:--3 double, 1 purl, 7
times alternately 2 double, 1 purl, then 3 double, and join the
knots into a circle. Work 3 similar leaves close to this 1st leaf,
but instead of working the 1st purl, fasten them on to the last
purl of the preceding leaf; besides this, instead of <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">[66 ]</a></span> working
the last purl of the 4th branch, fasten it on to the first purl of
the 1st branch. When 1 such four-branched pattern is completed,
knot both ends of the cotton together and cut them off. Make a row
of similar patterns by joining them on to the 2 middle purl of a
branch of the preceding pattern, instead of working the 2 middle
purl of the last branch (see illustration). Two rows of similar
patterns are joined by the above-mentioned circles, consisting of
32 double stitches, by fastening these circles from illustration
between four branched patterns. Begin each circle with 2 double
stitches, fasten it on to the corresponding purl of the
four-branched pattern, work again 2 double, fasten on to the next
purl, and continue in the same manner till the circle is
sufficiently large. Each circle is ornamented with lace stitch. The
collar is edged round the neck with close button-hole stitches.</p>

<p>58.--<em>Tatting Medallion for Trimming Lingeries,
&amp;c.c.</em></p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 50
for cravats and collars, 100 for pocket-handkerchiefs, 20 for
petticoats; tatting-pin No. 2 or 3.</p>

<center><a name="image_58"><img alt="Tatting Medallion." src=
"images/image058.jpg" width="292" height="428"></a></center>

<p>This pattern is suitable for trimming cravats, collars,
pocket-handkerchiefs, petticoats, &amp;c.c., according to the size
of the cotton with which it is worked. Work first the round of
circles which incloses the leaves, overlapping each other in the
centre; begin with the smallest circle, which is at the top of the
pattern; it consists of 3 double, 1 purl, 7 double, 1 purl, 7
double, 1 purl, 3 double. Then work at a short distance another
circle like the preceding one, only work 8 double instead of 7, and
instead of working the first purl, fasten the circle on to the last
purl of the preceding circle; all the other circles are fastened on
to each other in the same manner. The next circle, worked again at
a distance of about one-fifth of an inch, has 4 double; fasten it
on to the preceding circle, 9 double, 1 purl, 9 double, 1 purl, 4
double. The following four circles are worked like the preceding
one; only work in the first of these circles 10 double instead of
9, in the second 11 double, in the third 12 double. The piece of
cotton which joins the circles together must also be somewhat
longer between the larger circles. Then work a circle <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">[69]</a></span> as
follows: 5 double, fasten the cotton, 13 double, 1 purl, 13 double,
1 purl, 5 double; then a similar circle, but always working 14
double instead of 13. The next circle consists of 6 double, fasten
the cotton, 15 double, 1 purl, 15 double, 1 purl, 6 double; the two
following circles are worked in the same manner, working 16 double
instead of 15. Then comes the largest circle of the round, which
consists of 6 double, 17 double, 1 purl, 17 double, 1 purl, 6
double. Work 11 circles more <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_70" id="page_70">[70]</a></span> like the 2nd to 12th of
those just described (the 13th circle forms the middle), only the
order of sizes must be reversed, so that the round closes with the
smallest circle. Then fasten both ends of the cotton together, so
that the circles are joined into a circle. Then work round this row
of circles another round, the circles of which must be of graduated
sizes like those of the first round. Fasten the cotton on to the
middle purl of the first small circle of the first round, and work
one circle as follows:--3 double, 1 purl, 6 times alternately 2
double, 1 purl, then 3 double; fasten the cotton on to the middle
purl of the next circle, &amp;c.c. The remaining circles are worked
in the same manner, only they must be increased and decreased in
size gradually like the circles of the first round; this is done by
increasing or decreasing the number of purl, instead of working the
first purl of every following circle, fasten it on to the last purl
of the preceding circle. When the round is completed, fasten both
ends of the cotton together. In the centre of the oval pattern,
fasten 6 five-branched patterns of graduated size, which are worked
in one piece. For the smallest of these patterns work first three
circles, consisting of 5 double, 1 purl, 5 times alternately 2
double, 1 purl, then again 5 double (these circles must be close to
each other; the second and third circles must, moreover, be
fastened on to the last purl of the preceding circle). The cotton
is then fastened on the first circle between the beginning and the
end of the same, then work close to them two small circles,
consisting of 6 double, 1 purl, 6 double, fasten the cotton between
the beginning and the end of the third circle. The other
five-branched patterns are worked in the same manner at intervals
of about three-tenths of an inch; but the separate circles of each
pattern must become gradually larger. In the largest pattern the
three large circles consist of 5 double, 1 purl, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">[71]</a></span> 8 times
alternately 2 double, 1 purl, 5 double; the two smaller circles
consist each of 15 double, 1 purl, 15 double; the size of the other
patterns can easily be worked from this; the cotton which joins
these last together is covered by over-casting with a needle and
thread, so as to imitate double stitches. The five-branched
patterns are then fastened in the oval pattern; they must overlap
each other to half way, as seen in the illustration.</p>

<center><a name="image_59"><img alt="Tatted Diamond." src=
"images/image059.jpg" width="190" height="198"></a></center>

<p>This pattern is meant to ornament lingerie; it is worked with
fine tatting cotton in the following manner:--Work a * circle
consisting of 6 double, 1 purl, 6 double, turn the circle downwards
and work at a short distance another circle consisting of 5 double,
4 purl divided by 2 double, 5 double; at a similar distance a
circle of 5 double fastened on to the last purl of the preceding
circle, 2 double, 5 purl divided by 2 double, 5 double; then again
a circle consisting of 5 double fastened on to the last purl of the
preceding circle, 2 double, 3 purl divided by 2 <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">[72]</a></span> double, 5
double: fasten the cotton on to the first circle. Then turn the
work so that the last three circles are turned downwards, leave an
interval of at least three-fourths of an inch, and repeat three
times more from *, fastening the circles on to each other from
illustration. Knot together the beginning and end of the cotton,
work button-hole stitches round the cotton which joins the circles,
as shown in illustration. The purl stitches of the four middle
circles of the diamond are knotted together.</p>

<p>60.--<em>Tatted Cravat End</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 50;
tatting-pin No. 3; 2 shuttles.</p>

<p>This cravat end is given in full size. It is ornamented with a
tatted medallion, edged with lace. The tatting is worked with
tatting fine cotton and two shuttles. Make first the two rosettes
which form the centre of the medallion, then the insertion-like
part which edges the rosettes. The larger rosette is worked as
follows:--Knot the cotton of both shuttles together and work with 1
shuttle only 1 circle consisting of 10 double, 1 purl one-fifth of
an inch long, 10 double; * close to this circle, which is turned
downwards, work over the cotton with the other shuttle, 1 double, 1
purl, 8 double; this forms one of the scallops joining two circles.
Then turn the work again and work close to the just completed
scallop another circle like the first, but which is joined to the
first circle instead of working the purl. Repeat 4 times more from
*. Then work another scallop and fasten both ends of cotton on to
the cotton over which the first scallop has been worked, at the
place where the scallop is joined to the first circle. The first
round of the rosette is thus completed.</p>

<center><a name="image_60"><img alt="Tatted Cravat End." src=
"images/image060.jpg" width="212" height="265"></a></center>

<p>Work then the 2nd round over the cotton on the 2nd shuttle,
beginning to work where the two ends of cotton have <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">[73]</a></span> been
fastened, * 6 double, 1 purl, 5 double, fastened on to the purl of
the next scallop of the preceding round, 5 double, 1 purl, 6 double
fastened on to the cotton between two scallops of the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">[74]</a></span> preceding
round; repeat 5 times more from *. The larger rosette is now
completed. The smaller rosette is worked like the first, only
without the second round. The insertion-like border is worked in
two halves as follows:--The half which touches the edge of the
medallion is worked as follows:--Knot both ends of cotton together
and *, work with 1 shuttle only 1 circle consisting of 8 double, 1
purl one-fifth of an inch long, 8 double; turn the circle downwards
and work close to it over the cotton on the 2nd shuttle 6 double, 1
purl, 6 double; this forms a scallop of the border. Then turn the
work again and work close to the scallop another circle like the
first, but which is fastened on to the first circle instead of
working the purl. Turn the work again, work a scallop like the
preceding one, and repeat 15 times more from *, only the scallops
at the lower edge of the medallion must have a few double stitches
more, as can be seen in illustration. After working the last
scallop fasten the two ends of the cotton on to the 1st circle;
then cut them off. The second inner half is worked like the first;
only the circles are worked without any purl stitch, and fastened
on to the circles of the first half from illustration; the scallops
of this half are somewhat smaller; each consists of 5 double, 1
purl, 5 double. The completed border is sewn on to the rosettes
from illustration; the different pieces must be first fastened on
cardboard. The cotton must be wound several times round the long
threads, as seen in illustration. The medallion is then sewn into
the muslin at the top only; the remaining border is edged, before
joining it to the muslin, with a straight row of knots to be worked
over cotton, and fastened on to each outer scallop of the border at
regular intervals. The number of double stitches between two purl
is different, as distinctly seen in illustration. For the lace knot
both ends of cotton together, * work with one shuttle only 1 circle
<span class="newpage"><a name="page_75" id=
"page_75">[75]</a></span> consisting of 8 double, 1 purl, 8 double;
turn the work and make another circle consisting of 2 double, 9
times alternately 1 purl, 2 double; then fasten this circle on to
the preceding one, where it has been joined into a circle, so that
both circles meet as seen in illustration. After having turned the
work again, work 9 double over the cotton on the 2nd shuttle, which
form a scallop between the circles, and repeat from *. The lace is
then sewn round the edge of the muslin.</p>

width="225" height="205"></a></center>

<p>This rosette is suitable for ornamenting lingeries, cravats,
&amp;c.c. It is worked in white embroidery and lace stitch, and
edged all round with a tatted lace. For the latter work with very
fine cotton * 1 large circle, consisting of 5 double, 1 purl, 7
times alternately 2 double, 1 purl, then 5 double. At a short
distance from this circle work a smaller one, consisting of 5
double fastened on to the last purl of the large circle, 5 double.
Leave again an interval as small as the last, and repeat from <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">[76]</a></span> * 11
times more. But in working the large circles, instead of working
the 1st purl, fasten them on the same purl of the large circle on
which the small circle has been fastened; besides this, in working
the last (12th) large circle, instead of working the last purl,
fasten it on the 1st purl of the 1st circle; the last small circle
is fastened on to the same purl. The lace is thus joined into a
circle, and is sewn round the outside of the rosette with
button-hole stitches.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 60;
tatting-pin No. 3.</p>

<p>The illustration shows the end of a tatted cravat. Work first
the middle row of the cravat at the same time with the row of
circles on the left side of the middle row in illustration; begin
with the first circle of <span class="newpage"><a name="page_77"
id="page_77">[77]</a></span> the middle row. It consists of 7 times
alternately 3 double, 1 small purl, then 3 double. Work close to
this circle, which must be turned downwards, a Josephine knot,
consisting of 5 plain stitches, then a circle consisting of 5
double, 1 purl one-fifth of an inch long, 5 times alternately 3
double, 1 small purl; 3 double, 1 long purl, 5 double. *Turn this
circle (which is the first of the side row) downwards, work close
to it a Josephine knot, then a circle consisting of 12 double, 1
small purl, 12 double. Turn this circle downwards, work a Josephine
knot, and then again a circle like the first of the side row, but
instead of working the first long purl, fasten it on to the last
purl of the preceding circle of the same row. Then hold the work so
that the circles of the side row are turned downwards, work a
Josephine knot, 1 circle like the first circle of the middle row,
turn the work, make 1 Josephine knot, and then a circle like the
second circle of the side row. Repeat from * till the cravat is
sufficiently long. The last circle of the middle row must
correspond to the first circle of the same row. Then begin to work
the lower edge at the same time with the last circle of the middle
row, * 1 Josephine knot, then a circle like the circles of the side
row, again 1 Josephine knot, fastened on to the next purl of the
last circle of the middle row; repeat 3 times more from *. Then
continue as before, and work on the right side of the middle row a
row of circles exactly like those which have been worked at the
same time with those of the middle row.</p>

<p>The fastening on of the cotton between two Josephine knots is
seen in illustration. The circles at the other end of the cravat
are fastened like those of the first-described end. The cravat is
edged all round with a row of circles with Josephine knots worked
exactly like those of the preceding row, and the manner of
fastening which is seen in the illustration.</p>

<center><a name="image_64"><img alt=
"Cravat End in Tatting and Darned Netting." src=

<p>The end of this cravat is ornamented with a square of darned
netting, edged with a tatted border, and sewn on to the material of
the cravat. But the diamond in tatting (page 18), or the square
(page 31) will look <span class="newpage"><a name="page_80" id=
"page_80">[80]</a></span> very pretty with this border. The square
is worked in diamond netting, and has seven holes in length and
breadth. They are darned in linen stitch, darning stitch, and
<em>point d'esprit</em>, with Mecklenburg thread. The ground is
worked over a mesh measuring three-tenths of an inch round. For
each square one more row than is needed must be worked, and the
cast-on stitches are cut off, as they are longer than the stitches
of the other rows. The tatted border is worked with fine tatting
cotton. Fasten the cotton at one corner of the square and work * a
circle consisting of 7 double, 1 purl, then six times alternately 2
double, 1 purl, 7 double, fasten the cotton on to the same stitch
of the ground where it was first fastened; #work a second circle
like the first, but fasten it, instead of working the first purl on
to the last purl of the preceding circle; fasten the cotton again
on to the same stitch, then on to the next stitch, and work a small
circle, consisting of 5 double fastened on to the last purl of the
preceding circle, 4 double, 1 purl, 5 double. The cotton is
fastened on to the same netted stitch as before, and then on to the
next stitch; repeat twice more from #, and then repeat from * in
all three times more, so that the square is edged all round. It is
sewn into the material from the illustration.</p>

<p>65.--<em>Tatted Antimacassar. (See pages</em> <a href=
"#page_574">574-5</a>).</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s Boar's Head cotton No.
30, or tatting cotton No. 24, or for a larger size tatting cotton
No. 20; tatting-pin No. 1; large shuttle.</p>

<p>The illustration shows the fourth of the antimacassar and the
whole of the rosette which forms the centre. Begin with the latter,
with the five-branched pattern in the centre, at the same time with
the following round of circles:--*Work first one circle of this
round, consisting of 3 double, 1 purl, 4 times alternately 2
double, 1 purl, 3 double; then at <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_81" id="page_81">[81]</a></span> a short distance a circle
like the one just made, in which, however, instead of working the
first purl, the cotton must be joined on to the last purl of the
preceding circle. Then work at a short distance the first leaf of
the five-branched pattern, which consists of 4 double, 1 purl, 4
double. When this branch is completed, repeat at a short distance 4
times more from *; but in working the branches of the five-branched
pattern, instead of working the purl, join it on to the purl of the
first branch of the five-branched pattern (this purl forms the
centre of the pattern). All the circles must also be joined one to
each other, as can be seen from illustration. Then work the
scallops round the border of the rosette, * fasten the cotton on to
the purl which joins the two next circles of the preceding round,
and work one scallop consisting of 11 times alternately 2 double, 1
purl, then 2 double. Repeat 9 times more from *. When the rosette
is completed, work eight rosettes in the same manner and join them
into a circle from illustration by means of small three-branched
patterns, and then join them on to the middle rosette.</p>

<p>The strip of insertion which comes next is worked in two halves
as follows:--Work first, for the half turned towards the centre,
two rows of circles lying opposite each other; begin with one of
the largest circles, consisting of 4 double, 1 purl, 3 times
alternately 2 double, 1 purl, then 4 double; * at a short distance
work a smaller circle of 4 double, 1 purl, 4 double; after another
short distance, a circle like the first joined on to it; then again
a smaller circle, which at the place of the first purl is joined on
to the purl of the preceding small circle. A short distance from
this work again one of the larger circles just described, which is
fastened on to the preceding similar circle; then repeat from *
till the double row has nine larger and eight smaller circles. The
first half of the strip of insertion is completed; the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">[82]</a></span> second
outer half is worked like the first, only the small circles must
here be worked without any purl, and two of them together must
always be fastened on to the two joined small circles of the first
half, as was done for the five-branched pattern of the rosette;
besides this, each of the large circles has 4 double, 1 purl, 4
times alternately 2 double, 1 purl, then 4 double. When eight
similar patterns have been worked, join them into a circle from
illustration by means of small rosettes; this circle is then joined
to the already-finished part of the cover. The small rosettes and
remaining patterns of the antimacassar are easily worked from
illustration. The completed patterns are joined together in the
course of the work.</p>

<p>Ladies at a distance from town or on the Continent will be glad
to have some guide as to the quantity of cotton required to
complete their work. The quantity of tatting or crochet cotton used
by an average worker is found to be two yards to the square inch
with a single shuttle; three yards to the square inch with two
shuttles.</p>

<h2>EMBROIDERY</h2>

<a name="EMBROIDERY_INSTRUCTIONS"></a>
<h3>EMBROIDERY INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<p>The art of embroidering with cotton on linen, muslin, cambric,
piqu&eacute;, &amp;c.c., is very easy to learn by strictly
attending to the following instructions.</p>

<p>The size of the thread and needle must correspond to that of the
material on which you embroider; the needle must not be too long,
and the cotton must be soft. Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s
embroidery cotton is the best. Skilful embroiderers never work over
anything, because when you tack the material on paper or cloth each
stitch shows, and if the material is very fine, leaves small holes;
but for those that are learning we should advise them to tack the
material to be embroidered upon a piece of <em>toile
cir&eacute;e</em>. If you work without this, place the material
straight over the forefinger of the left hand; the material must
never be held slantways. The three other fingers of the left hand
hold the work; the thumb remains free to give the right position to
each stitch. The work must always, if possible, lie so that the
outline of the pattern is turned towards the person who works. For
the sake of greater clearness one part of the following
illustrations is given in larger size than nature. Preparing the
patterns is one of the most important things in embroidery, for the
shape of the patterns is often spoiled merely because they have not
been prepared with sufficient care.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_84" id=
"page_84">[84]</a></span>

<center><a name="image_66"><img alt="Scallop." src=
"images/image066.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 66 shows how to prepare a scallop. Take thicker
cotton than that with which you work; never commence with a knot,
and do not take a thread longer than sixteen or eighteen inches.
The outlines of the scallops are first traced with short straight
stitches. In the corners particularly the stitches must be short.
The space between the outlines is filled with chain stitches, as
can be seen from illustration; they must not be too long, otherwise
the embroidery will look coarse. It is in this way that every
pattern to be worked in button-hole or satin stitch is to be
prepared.</p>

<center><a name="image_67"><img alt="Double Overcast Stitch." src=
"images/image067.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 67 shows the double overcast stitch or button-hole
stitch in a straight line. After having traced the outline begin to
work from left to right; fasten the cotton with a few stitches,
hold it with the thumb of the left hand under the outline, insert
the needle downwards above the outline, draw it out under the same
above the cotton which you hold in the left hand, and draw it up.
Repeat for all the stitches in the same manner; they must be
regular and lie close to one another. Great care should be taken
that the material on which you embroider is not puckered.</p>

<center><a name="image_68"><img alt="Overcast Stitch." src=
"images/image068.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 68 (<em>Overcast Stitch</em>).--The double overcast
and the button-hole stitches are worked from left to right, whilst
back stitches, knotted and satin stitches are worked from right to
left. The stitch is worked in the same way as the double overcast,
only the needle must never be drawn out <em>above</em>, but
<em>below</em>, the cotton with which you work, and which you keep
down with the thumb of the left hand.</p>

<center><a name="image_69"><img alt="Slanting Overcast Stitch."
src="images/image069.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 69.--The slanting overcast stitch is worked without
tracing the outline, always inserting the needle downwards--that
is, from top to bottom. The needle must be inserted in the manner
shown in illustration--that is, not straight, but slanting; insert
it a little farther than the last stitch, and draw it out close to
it. The wrong side of the work must show back stitches. This sort
of stitch is used for the fine outlines in patterns or letter.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_86" id=
"page_86">[86]</a></span>

<center><a name="image_70"><img alt="Back Stitch." src=
"images/image070.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 70.--This shows the back stitch, the working of
which is well known; it is worked in several rows close to each
other.</p>

<center><a name="image_71"><img alt="Point Crois&eacute;." src=
"images/image071.jpg"></a></center>

<center><a name="image_72"><img alt="Point Crois&eacute;." src=
"images/image072.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 71 &amp; 72 show another kind of back stitch,
called <em>point crois&eacute;</em>, which is only used on very
thin and transparent materials. This stitch forms on the wrong side
a sort of darned pattern, which is seen by transparence on the
right side, and gives the embroidered pattern a thicker appearance,
contrasting with the rest of the work (see the lower leaves of the
flower on illustration <a href="#image_110">110</a>). For this
stitch insert the needle into the material as for the common back
stitch, draw it out underneath the needle on the opposite outline
of the pattern, so as to form on the wrong side a slanting line.
Insert the needle again as for common back stitch; draw it out
slanting at the place marked for the next stitch on the opposite
outline, as shown in illustration 71.</p>

<center><a name="image_73"><img alt="Knotted Stitch." src=
"images/image073.jpg"></a></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_87" id=
"page_87">[87]</a></span>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 73 shows the knotted stitch; the simplest way of
working it is to work two back stitches at a short distance from
each other over the same thread.</p>

<p>The knotted stitch seen in ILLUSTRATION 74 is worked thus:--Take
about four threads of the material on the needle, draw the needle
half out, wind the cotton twice round the point of the needle, hold
it tight with the thumb, draw the needle out carefully and insert
it at the place where the stitch was begun, and draw it out at the
place where the next stitch is to be worked.</p>

<center><a name="image_74"><img alt="Knotted Stitch." src=
"images/image074.jpg"></a></center>

<center><a name="image_75"><img alt="Knotted Stitch" src=
"images/image075.jpg"></a></center>

<p>The knotted stitch seen on ILLUSTRATION 75 is worked in nearly
the same manner as the preceding one. Before drawing the cotton out
of the material hold it tight with the left-hand thumb; leave the
needle in the same position, wind the cotton twice round it, turn
the needle from left to right, so (follow the direction of the
arrow) that its point arrives where the cotton was drawn out
(marked by a cross in illustration), insert the needle there, and
draw it out at the place of the next stitch.</p>

<center><a name="image_76"><img alt="Raised Satin Stitch." src=
"images/image076.jpg"></a></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_88" id=
"page_88">[88]</a></span>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 76 &amp; 77.--Raised satin stitch is principally
used for blossoms, flowers, leaves, letters, &amp;c.c. After having
traced the outlines of the pattern, fill the space left between
them with chain stitches in a direction different from that in
which the pattern is to be embroidered; begin at the point of the
leaf, working from right to left, make short straight stitches,
always inserting the needle close above the outline and drawing it
out below. The leaves on the flowers, as well as on the branches,
must be begun from the point, because they thus acquire a better
shape. If you wish to work a leaf divided in the middle, as seen in
illustration 77, you must trace the veining before you fill it with
chain stitches, then begin at one point of the leaf and work first
one half and then the other.</p>

<center><a name="image_77"><img alt="Raised Satin Stitch." src=
"images/image077.jpg"></a></center>

<center><a name="image_78"><img alt="Point de Plume." src=
"images/image078.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 78 shows the so-called <em>point de plume</em> on a
scalloped leaf. It is worked like the satin stitch, only the needle
is drawn through the material in a slanting direction.</p>

<center><a name="image_79"><img alt="Point de Minute." src=
"images/image079.jpg"></a></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_89" id=
"page_89">[89]</a></span>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 79 (<em>Point de Minute</em>).--This stitch is
often used instead of satin stitch when the patterns must appear
raised. Wind the cotton several times round the point of the
needle, which is inserted into the material half its length (the
number of times the cotton is to be wound round the needle depends
on the length of the pattern), hold fast the windings with the
thumb of the left hand, draw the needle and the cotton through the
windings, insert the needle into the material at the same place,
and draw it out at the place where the next stitch is to begin.</p>

<center><a name="image_80"><img alt="Ladder Stitch." src=
"images/image080.jpg"></a></center>

<center><a name="image_81"><img alt="Ladder Stitch." src=
"images/image081.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 80 &amp; 81 show the <em>ladder stitch</em>, often
used in ornamental embroidery. Trace first the outlines as seen in
illustrations; mark also the cross stitches between the outlines,
so that the first touch the outlines only at both ends. The
outlines are embroidered in overcast stitch or double overcast; the
material is cut away underneath the ladder stitch between the
outlines.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_90" id=

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 86 &amp; 87 (<em>Button-holes and
Eyelets</em>).--This kind of embroidery is used only in round or
long patterns. Trace first the outline of the hole, cut away a
small round piece of material, not too close to the outlines (when
the button-hole is very small merely insert the point of the
scissors or a stiletto into the material), fold the edge of the
material back with the needle, and work the hole in overcast
stitch, inserting the needle into the empty place in the centre and
drawing it out under the outline. Some button-holes are worked
separately; sometimes they are in a row; if so, take care to begin
to work each button-hole at the place where it touches the next. In
the following button-holes the outside must be traced double, so as
to reach as far as the next one, but each button-hole is finished
at once. Illustration 86 shows a button-hole worked round in
button-hole stitch, 87 an eyelet-hole worked in overcast.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 95 to 97 (<em>Leaf in Raised

beautiful, as it is worked separately and sewn on the material with
an outline in very fine cotton, this produces the shade seen in 95
(see also illustrations 98 to 113). For such leaves work first one
half in overcast and satin stitch (illustration 96); the other half
is worked on a separate piece of material (see illustration 97);
cut away the material along the overcast outline, and fasten it on
the foundation material along the outline which forms the veining
on illustration 96.</p>

the material underneath the ladder stitch. The cross stitches are
then worked in darning stitch with very fine cotton wherever two
threads meet.</p>

bead, over which the embroidery is worked. When the leaves have
been worked one after the other, place a bead in the centre, left
free in such a manner that one hole lies on the material, and work
over the bead by inserting the needle into its upper hole, then
underneath the material, drawing it out above the material close to
the bead, and so on (see 103).</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 116 &amp; 117 (<em>Flower worked in
Appliqu&eacute;</em>).--To work in appliqu&eacute;, two materials,
either similar or different, are needed. You can work either in
appliqu&eacute; of muslin on muslin, or of muslin on net, or of net
on net. Muslin on Brussels net is the prettiest way of working in
appliqu&eacute;; we will therefore describe it: the other materials
are worked in the same manner. <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_101" id="page_101">[101]</a></span>Trace the pattern on the
muslin, fasten the latter on the net, and trace the outlines of the
pattern with very small stitches work them in overcast stitch with
very fine cotton, taking care not to pucker the material. The
veinings are worked in overcast. When the pattern has been
embroidered cut away the muslin round the outlines with sharp
scissors, so that the net forms the grounding (see No. 117). The
greatest care is required in cutting out the muslin to avoid
touching the threads of the net.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 118 &amp; 119 (<em>Narrow Borders</em>).--It will
be easy to work these borders from the above instructions. Observe
only that on border 118 the outer row of scallops is worked first,
then the button-hole stitch row, and the rest afterwards. The spots
are edged all round in knotted stitch. The wheels in the centre of
the eyelets of No. 119 are worked with very fine cotton in loose
button-hole stitch; they are wound round with the cotton in a
second row.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 120 TO 122.--Three strips of insertion, which are
worked nearly like the ladder stitch. For No. 120, in tracing the
outlines, make two small knots at short distances by winding the
cotton four times round the needle, as can be seen in illustration;
the windings are held down with the thumb of the left hand, draw
the needle through, and a knot is formed. The outlines are worked
in button-hole stitch only when all the knots have been made, and
then the material is cut away underneath. Illustration 121 is a
variety of the slanting ladder stitch.</p>

<p>Illustration 122.--The cross threads are worked in two rows in
the common herring-bone stitch, as can be seen by the black lines
on the illustration. The straight lines at the top and at the
bottom are worked in double overcast; lastly, the wheels are worked
in a row as described for the star pattern, No. 104.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 123 To 129 (<em>Embroidered Initials</em>).--To
learn to work initials the Roman characters are the easiest to
begin with. They must be traced and prepared like other embroidery
in satin stitch, only the chain stitches underneath must not be too
thick: it would take away the shape of the letters. All depends on
the fineness and regularity of the stitches; they must be worked in
overcast stitch. Work from left to right, and the letter when
completed must look rather like raised printing than like
embroidery. Gothic letters are much more difficult to work on
account of the many flourishes; it requires great practice in
needlework to embroider them well.</p>

on the thick parts of the letter: the fine strokes are covered with
cross threads of black silk.</p>

<h2>EMBROIDERY</h2>

<a name="EMBROIDERY_PATTERNS"></a>
<h3>EMBROIDERY PATTERNS</h3>

<p>[In working the following Embroidery Patterns it will be found
advisable to trace the design clearly upon tracing-paper with a
sharp-pointed lead pencil. The pattern thus traced must be
perforated with a fine needle in a succession of tiny holes, at the
rate of about twenty to the inch. Those ladies who possess a
sewing-machine will find no difficulty in accomplishing this.
Several thicknesses of paper can be perforated at the same time, if
required, by any ordinary machine. To transfer the traced and
perforated design to the fabric to be embroidered, it is only
necessary to rub a small quantity of powder blue through the
holes.]</p>

<p>131.--<em>Insertion in Embroidery</em>.</p>

<p>Material: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s embroidery cotton No.
16.</p>

<p>This insertion is worked in raised satin stitch and buttonhole
stitch. The outlines must first be traced and the space filled up
with chain stitches. To work a leaf, begin at the point, working
from right to left, making short stitches, and always inserting the
needle close above the outline and drawing it out below. The holes
left for the ribbon to pass through are worked in plain button-hole
stitch, the dots are worked in raised satin stitch.</p>

cashmere; the lining is of fine linen. Before embroidering it, make
the points for the corners. The embroidery is worked in button-hole
stitch, overcast, satin, and ladder stitch. It can also be worked
on fine cambric or muslin, and then the embroidered pattern sewn on
the piece of linen which forms the cover on the wrong side. Make
the button-holes as seen on illustration, and sew on

edges. The words "Bon appetit," or "Good appetite," at will, are
worked over it in overcast with black purse silk and steel beads,

front of the case are formed of the same strip, which is lined with
oilskin, and to which narrow side-pieces are added to form the

the back and front, and then the scallops of both sides are joined
together, and worked round in button-hole stitch with purse
silk.</p>

<p>The case is fastened down with a steel button.</p>

<p>If another colour is preferred, the sandwich case can be made of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page_125" id=

then be worked in rich blue purse silk, and gold beads used for the

edge may be worked in double overcast stitch in blue or black silk.
A gold button must replace the steel when this alteration of colour
is made.</p>

like the petals, but with 3 stitches of white silk at the point
instead of 1. The leaves are worked in 2 shades of green wool with

When you have worked all the square thus, 12 stitches one from the
other, work on either side, at one stitch's distance, the outlines
of yellow silk, which are worked in back stitch, two strips of the
Java canvas being covered by each stitch. Next to the inner yellow
outline comes a border worked over two strips of the canvas, in
slanting stitches; this border is alternately blue in one square
and grey in the other. A star is embroidered in point Russe in the
centre of each square; it is grey in the blue squares and blue in
the grey; a steel bead is placed in the middle of each star. The
small crosses between the squares are worked in cerise. The outer
border of the work is composed of a piece of black soutache, edged
with a tiny trefoil pattern in cerise silk. The front and back
pieces of the bag are worked in the same manner. The side pieces
are made of plain Java canvas. The embroidered part measures 14
inches in its widest part, and is 11 inches deep. The bag is lined

<p>171, 172, <em>and</em> 173--<em>Toilet Cushion Cover in White
Embroidery</em>.</p>

<p>This handsome embroidery pattern is to be worked on fine muslin;
if lined with coloured silk or satin it is very effective. The
patterns, which are covered white dots on illustration, are worked
in point d'or; the outlines of these patterns are worked in fine
double overcast. The flower-leaves and wings of birds, which appear
raised on illustration on account of the dark shadows, are worked
separately and sewn on at the corresponding places. No. 172 shows
the wing of a bird, No. 173 a rose-leaf somewhat increased in size;
the former is worked entirely in button-hole stitch, or trimmed
with a ruche of coloured ribbon. This pattern may also be worked on
glac&eacute; silk with purse silk.</p>

<p>The ornamentation of this box is both novel and tasteful. It is
embroidered in coloured silks, upon light blue cashmere. Part of
the embroidery pattern is given in full size. All the outlines are
worked in overcast, the stitches being made rather long and
slanting, and the small leaves are each composed of one stitch, as
in point Russe. The leaves are alternately red and yellow upon a
green stem; the scalloped outline which has no leaves is red. The
pine patterns are worked in satin stitch--the centre one is green,
edged with red; the side ones are pink, edged with red; the small
wing-like figures are black, edged with maize; the diamond, maize,
edged with black, with an outer rim of maize. In the round pattern
the centre is pink; the edge red, with red and yellow leaves; the 3
outer circles are successively white, green, and <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">[148]</a></span> red; at
the top the centre branch is yellow, the leaves red and yellow, the
side ones are green, with the leaves pink and green.</p>

<p>The strip of embroidered cashmere is lined with blue silk,
slipped through the bamboo-canes of the mounting, and joined
together at the side by a seam. The cover is lined with plain blue
cashmere, upon which initials might be embroidered at discretion.
The four corners are ornamented with pretty silk tassels, of
colours to match with the embroidery. To fasten the box, sew on a
blue ribbon to the cover, and one to the box.</p>

<p>This embroidery pattern is worked between the borders of a
handkerchief, which may be either of French cambric or grass lawn.
The design is simple, but effective, and very easy to work. If
worked on fine French cambric, the handkerchief should be lightly
tacked upon <em>toile cir&eacute;e</em>. The rows of raised dots
should be worked first, and then the graceful branches of pointed
leaves in satin stitch. The plain round dots might be worked in
bright red marking cotton in either of the patterns. To produce a
good effect, rather fine cotton must be selected, and No. 40 will
be found very effective on either lawn or cambric. For mourning
wear, this pattern should be embroidered with black filoselle, or
the leaves can be worked in white cotton, and the dots in
filoselle.</p>

for the centre if it is not intended to contrast with it. The
pattern can also be worked entirely in silk with satin stitch. The
size of the border may, of course, be increased if desired, but the
third pattern in the darkest shade must, in any case, form the
centre of it.</p>

<p>205.--<em>Lappet or Sash End in Venetian Embroidery.</em></p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s embroidery cotton No.
6 and No. 12; net and muslin.</p>

<p>The pattern must first be traced on muslin, which is then tacked
over net. The outlines are worked in button-hole stitch, and the
veinings are sewn over, using the coarse cotton for tracing; the
muslin is then cut away all round the pattern.</p>

<center><a name="image_206"><img alt="Venetian Border." src=
"images/image206.jpg"></a></center>

<p>This design is elegant and effective, without there being a
great deal of work in it. It is useful for tuckers for evening
dresses or handkerchief borders. The muslin is laid over the net,
sewn neatly over, and then cut away between the pattern, leaving
the net for the ground work.</p>

<p><em>207.--Lace Insertion.</em></p>

<p>Materials: Fine black sewing silk; black Brussels net.</p>

<p>This lace insertion is first outlined in running stitch upon the
net; the leaves are then darned across the net holes; the stems are
worked in overcast stitch; the dots are embroidered by darning
across the circle previously outlined; the lace stitches in the
centre are formed by gently enlarging the net holes with a fine
stiletto, and then sewn lightly round, the remaining holes being
filled with lace stitches consisting of fine button-hole stitches,
very evenly worked over the entire space surrounding the open
holes.</p>

<p>To be effective the very finest black silk should be employed.
This pattern may be worked in appliqu&eacute; by placing muslin
over net, sewing all the outlines in fine overcast stitch, and when
finished, carefully cutting away the muslin.</p>

point Russe with green filoselle. It is lined with green silk, and
slightly quilted. The soles are of cork. The slipper is trimmed all
round with a ruche of green silk ribbon three-fifths of an inch
wide, pleated in double box pleats. The heel is turned down inside.
No. 209 shows the pattern of the point Russe stitch nearly full
size.</p>

<p>210 <em>and</em> 211.--<em>Medallions in Point Russe</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Coloured filoselle, cloth, velvet, cashmere, or
silk.</p>

<p>These medallions can be alternated for ornamenting small covers,
cushions, borders, &amp;c. They are worked with coloured filoselle
in point Russe, herring-bone stitch, coral stitch, and knotted
stitch, on cloth, velvet, cashmere, or silk. The middle oval of
both medallions contrasts with the colour of the ground, and must
therefore be worked in appliqu&eacute; on the latter with
herring-bone stitch, before working the outer border. The wreath on
No. 211 is worked in coral stitch; the knots, which imitate small
blossoms, in knotted stitch. The choice of colours is left to the
personal taste of the worker.</p>

<p>Materials: French lawn or cambric; fine black silk.</p>

<p>This butterfly is worked in the finest black silk procurable, in
order more closely to imitate etching. It is worked in point Russe
and scallop stitch; the dark shaded scallops are worked in
button-hole scallop stitch, the stitches being taken very closely
together, but not raised by the usual method of placing chain
stitches beneath the button-hole stitches. The outlines and flowers
are worked in point Russe, the dot in knotted stitch (see No. 73,
<em>Embroidery Instructions</em>.)</p>

<p>213 <em>to</em> 215.--<em>Pattern for a Couvrette in
Appliqu&eacute;</em>. (<em>see pages <a href=

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s embroidery cotton Nos.
24 and 30; cambric muslin; Brussels net; flesh-coloured silk;
sewing silk of the same shade; 1 skein of a darker shade; blue
silk; brown silk; gold thread.</p>

<p>This style of work is most effective for couvrettes or bed
covers. It is worked in cambric muslin and silk, over Brussels
net.</p>

<p>The arabesque patterns are worked in cambric muslin, the
outlines are embroidered in overcast, and the material is cut away
all round. The medallions are made of blue silk; the figures upon
them are cut out of flesh-coloured silk, and are gummed first upon
tissue-paper, then upon the blue silk; the figures are further
fastened upon the medallions in overcast stitch with fine silk of a
rather darker shade of flesh-colour. The scarfs are cut out of
bright rose-coloured silk; the quiver and arrows and all the other
attributes are worked in gold thread; the hair in fine brown silk.
The edge of the blue silk medallions is worked round in button-hole
stitch, but so as to be easily unripped when the couvrette has to
be cleaned. A border in open ladder stitch is worked round them
(see No. 81, <em>Embroidery Instructions</em>). The openings in the
centre pattern are also filled in with lace stitches.</p>

<h2>CROCHET</h2>

<h3>CROCHET INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<center><a name="image_c"><img alt="A Crochet Needle" src=
"images/imagec.jpg"><br>
<small>A Crochet-Needle</small></a></center>

<p>Cotton or thread, wool or silk, with a crochet-needle, are the
materials required for working crochet. The needle, whether it be
steel or bone, must be smoothly polished. The long wooden and bone
crochet-needles are used for wool; for cotton and silk work short
steel needles screwed into a bone handle are best. The beauty of
the crochet-work depends upon the regularity of the stitches, as is
the case with every other style of needlework. The stitches must be
elastic, but if too loose they look as bad as if too tight. The
size of the needle and that of the cotton or wool must correspond;
work only with the point of the needle, and never move the stitch
up and down the needle. The cotton with which you work must be of
the very best quality; for borders, insertions, rosettes, imitation
of guipure, use Evans's crochet cotton; for couvrettes,
counterpanes, covers, &amp;c., use knitting-cotton. All
crochet-work <span class="newpage"><a name="page_186" id=
"page_186">[186]</a></span> patterns are begun on a foundation
chain; there are three kinds of foundation chains--the plain
foundation, the double foundation, and the purl foundation
chain.</p>

<p>The plain foundation chain consists of chain stitches.</p>

<center><a name="image_216"><img alt="Plain Foundation Chain." src=
"images/image216.jpg"></a></center>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 216.--Form a loop with the cotton or other material
with which you work, take it on the needle, and hold the cotton as
for knitting on the forefinger and other fingers of the left hand.
The crochet-needle is held in the right hand between the thumb and
forefinger, as you hold a pen in writing; hold the end of the
cotton of the loop between the thumb and forefinger of the left
hand, wind the cotton once round the needle by drawing the needle
underneath the cotton from left to right, catch the cotton with the
hook of the needle and draw it as a loop through the loop already
on the needle, which is cast off the needle by this means and forms
one chain stitch. The drawing the cotton through the loop is
repeated until the foundation chain has <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_187" id="page_187">[187]</a></span> acquired sufficient
length. When enough chain stitches have been made, take the
foundation chain between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand,
so that these fingers are always close to and under the hook of the
needle. Each stitch must be loose enough to let the hook of the
needle pass easily through. All foundation chains are begun with a
loop.</p>

cotton as a loop through the left side of the last stitch (see

it through the stitch, wind the cotton again round the needle, and
at the same time draw the cotton through the last loop and through
the stitch formed by winding the cotton round the needle. Wind the
cotton once more round the needle, and draw it through the 2
remaining loops on the needle. The 4 chain stitches form a kind of
scallop or purl. Repeat from *. The following <span class=

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_207" id=
"page_207">[207]</a></span> the other 6 circles in the following
manner: join one ring to the second from the one that was sewed to
the 1st circle, join the next ring to the corresponding one of the
next circle (which will be the one opposite to the one sewed in the
1st circle), and repeat, joining the other 5 in the same way.</p>

<p>247.--<em>Stars in Crochet</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s crochet cotton No. 8
or 20.</p>

<p>This pattern can be used for a couvrette or pincushion cover,
according to the size of the cotton with which it is worked.</p>

<p>Each star is begun in the centre by a chain of 8 stitches. In
the 1st stitch work 1 treble, * 4 chain, 1 treble in this same 1st
stitch, repeat from * 3 times more, 4 chain, 1 slip stitch in the
4th of the 8 chain. You have thus formed 8 rays, joined to the 1st
stitch. Now work (without cutting the cotton) the branches, which
are begun from the centre.</p>

<p><em>1st branch.--1st round:</em> 18 chain, 1 treble in the 13th,
so as to form a purl with the last 5, 2 chain, 3 treble with 2
chain between, missing 2 stitches under the 2 chain, 2 chain, 1
slip stitch in the last of the 18 chain.</p>

the next stitch work 1 double, 1 chain, 1 double to form the point,
1 double in each <span class="newpage"><a name="page_212" id=
"page_212">[212]</a></span> of the 10 remaining stitches, 1 slip
stitch in the 1st stitch of the 1st round.</p>

<p><em>3rd round:</em> 3 double, 1 purl, repeat from * twice more,
then work in double crochet as far as the point, work 2 double with
1 chain between, then work the 2nd half of the branch the same as
the 1st. Before beginning the next leaf, work 5 double on the chain
stitches of the circle; work 6 branches, repeating alternately the
2 above explained; cut the cotton and fasten it on again to the
point of one of the branches, in order to join them together by the
two following rounds:--</p>

<p><em>1st round:</em> 1 double in the point of one of the leaves,
* 4 chain, 1 purl under the chain; thus make 5 chain, turn the
chain with the crochet to the right, insert the needle downwards in
the first chain, and make a slip stitch, 4 chain, 1 purl under, 4
chain, 1 purl under, 4 chain, 1 slip stitch in the point of the
next leaf, repeat from * five times more.</p>

<p><em>2nd round:</em> * 4 double over the nearest 4 chain; 1 purl
as usual--that is, above the chain--4 double over the next 4 chain.
Now work 1 trefoil (thus: 1 chain, 1 purl, 1 chain, 1 purl, 1
chain, 1 double in the 1 double coming just before the 3 purl). 1
double on each of the next 4 chain of last round, 1 purl, 5 double,
1 trefoil, repeat five times from *.</p>

<p>Join the stars by a few stitches, as seen in the
illustration.</p>

<p>Then work with cerise colour over a ring 19 stitches, take
another ring and work 19 stitches, repeat this till you have 6
rings, then work round the other half of each ring 19 stitches; and
when the 6 are finished, join the first to the last to make a
circle; sew the maize ring into the centre of it, then work over 12
rings with black in the same manner, and place them outside the
cerise circle. Then work over 16 rings with maize colour, and join
them beyond the black, but not to lie flat down; they are to stand
up to form the sides of the purse. Work over 16 rings with cerise,
and these you can join one to each of the former rounds in working
the second half of the crochet, as it will save the sewing. Work
over 16 rings in black, and join them in the same manner to the
cerise. For the edge, with cerise, work into the centre stitch of
the ring a stitch of double crochet, make 5 chain, work into the
stitch joining the 8 rings an extra long stitch, make 5 chain,

of raised spots being now completed, continue to work with the
lightest shade of red in double stitches, decreasing once above
each pattern, so as to close up the circle gradually. The white
flowers are worked over the plain part of the cushion with white
wool, and silk for the petals, and a black dot in the centre. The
cushion is stuffed with horsehair and lined with glazed calico. A
round of thick pasteboard is stitched in at the bottom, to make it

<p>The seat and back of this arm-chair are covered with two round
couvrettes, worked in crochet with Berlin wool of two colours. They
are fastened on the chair with woollen braid, finishing off with
tassels of the same colour. Begin each couvrette in the centre with
a foundation chain of 6 stitches, with the lightest wool; join them
into a circle, and work the 1st round in the following manner:--12
double.</p>

<p><em>2nd round:</em> * 3 chain, 1 double, in the next stitch of
the 1st round, <span class="newpage"><a name="page_224" id=
"page_224">[224]</a></span> inserting the needle in the upper part
of the stitch; repeat from * 11 times more; at the end of this
round work 1 slip stitch in the 1st chain of this round. We shall
not repeat any more the repetitions from * to the end of the
round.</p>

<p><em>3rd round:</em> * 4 chain, 1 double, in the next scallop of
the preceding round; at the end of the round 4 chain.</p>

<p><em>4th round:</em> 4 double in each scallop of the preceding
round.</p>

<p><em>5th round:</em> Begin to work with the darker wool and
crochet slip stitch, inserting the needle in the front chain of the
stitches of the 4th round.</p>

<p>The 6th round is worked once more with light wool, and consists
entirely of double stitch, worked by inserting the needle at the
back of the stitches of the 4th round, so that the slip stitches
appear raised on the right side of the work, and form a round of
chain stitches. The middle part of the couvrette is then
finished.</p>

<p>17th--19th rounds like the 7th--9th.</p>

<p><em>20th round:</em> Alternately 1 treble with the light wool, 1
treble with the dark; but every treble stitch must be cast off with
the wool of the colour of the next stitch; that is, a light treble
stitch with the dark wool, and a dark treble stitch with the light
wool. Now and then crochet 2 treble stitches in one stitch of the
preceding round, so that the couvrette remains perfectly flat.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_226" id=

<p><em>21st round:</em> 1 double in every stitch.</p>

<p>The 22nd--31st rounds consist of a double repetition of the
7th--11th rounds.</p>

<p>The 32nd and 33rd rounds are made in open work like the 7th and
8th rounds.</p>

<p>The 34th round is worked in treble stitches like the 20th round.
Then work the outer border. It consists of chain stitch scallops
which are worked alternately with dark and light wool. Illustration
No. 256 shows a part of the border with the treble round in full
size. Work from it with the light wool 1 double on 1 light treble
stitch of the preceding round, 5 chain, 1 double, on the next light
treble, throw the wool off the needle and let it hang over the
right side of the work; crochet with the dark wool 1 double on the
treble stitch between the 2 double of this round, leave the wool on
the right side of the work; 5 chain, 1 double, on the next dark
treble. Take the needle again out of the loop, draw the wool on to
the right side, and work the next chain stitch scallop again with
the light wool.</p>

<p>Instead of this border, pattern No. 255 may be worked. It
consists of 3 rounds to be worked after the 34th round of the
couvrette.</p>

<p><em>1st round of the border:</em> With dark wool, * 1 double in
1 stitch, of the 34th round; 1 double, 3 treble, 1 double, in the
next stitch; repeat from *.</p>

the needle in the next treble stitch of the 34th round, thus
working over the double stitch between the spots of the preceding
round; 1 chain.</p>

<p><em>3rd round:</em> * 3 double in each chain stitch of the
preceding round. To work the 2nd of these 3 double, insert the
needle at the same time in the upper part of the middle treble of
the 1st round.</p>

<p>These insertions are worked with crochet cotton of sizes which
depend upon the use you wish to make of them. The insertion seen in
illustration 258 is worked the long way in 8 rows. Make a
sufficiently long foundation chain, and work the 1st row as
follows:--1 slip stitch in the 1st stitch of the foundation, * 5
chain, miss 3, 1 double in the next stitch but 3, repeat from
*.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em>1 slip stitch in the middle of the 1st 5 chain,

<p><em>3rd row:</em> 1 treble in the 1st stitch, * 1 leaf worked as
follows: 6 chain, then without noticing the loop left on the needle
1 long treble in the 2nd and 1 in the 1st of the 6 chain; these

<p>The insertion seen in illustration 259 is worked in 6 rows, and
is begun in the centre on a foundation chain sufficiently long not
to be worked too tight.</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> 4 double in the 1st 4 stitches, * 4 double
divided in the same way on the other side of the foundation chain,
inserting the needle in the 1st row into the 2 chain. Illustration
260 shows an insertion which imitates darned netting; it is worked
on a grounding imitating netting with raised figures. The grounding
consists of 9 rows. Work on a sufficiently long foundation chain
the 1st row as follows: 1 cross <span class="newpage"><a name=

<p><em>3rd to 8th rows:</em> 1 double in the middle stitch of every
chain stitch scallop, 4 chain between. 9th row: Like the 1st. Work
from illustration square patterns on this grounding, consisting
each of 4 leaves; for these leaves carry on the cotton taken double
in double windings from 1 double stitch to another, so as to have 4
threads lying close to each other; darn these as can be seen in

<p>A particular kind of purl makes this border look very like
guipure lace. Begin with a foundation chain worked in the following
manner:--* 3 chain, the last of them forms 1 purl; this is made by
drawing out a long <span class="newpage"><a name="page_230" id=
"page_230">[230]</a></span> loop on the needle, taking the needle
out of the loop, inserting it in the chain stitch before the last
one, drawing the cotton through it, and continuing to work so that
the loop out of which the needle has been drawn forms 1 purl. All
the purl must be equally long; to do this more easily the loop may
be kept on the needle till a chain stitch has been worked in that
which comes just before the purl, continue the foundation chain,
and repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> 1 long double in the 1st stitch of the
foundation, * 1 chain, 1 slip stitch in the nearest purl of the
foundation chain; repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> 1 double in the 1st stitch, * 1 purl, 1 chain,
missing 1 stitch under it; 1 slip stitch in the slip stitch of the
preceding row; repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> Like the 1st.</p>

<p><em>4th row:</em> 1 double in the 1st stitch, * 1 purl, 5 chain,
1 purl, 1 chain, missing 5 stitches under them; 1 double in the 6th
stitch; repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>5th row:</em> 1 long double in the 1st stitch, 3 chain, 1
purl, 1 chain, * 1 double in the middle of the next 5 chain of the
preceding row, 1 purl, 5 chain, 1 purl, 1 chain; repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>6th to 9th rows:</em> Alternately like the 4th and 5th
rows.</p>

<p><em>10th row:</em> 1 double in the 1st stitch, * 6 chain, 1
double long treble (throw the cotton 3 times round the needle) in
the 1st of these chain stitches; the stitch is only completed so
far as still to leave 2 loops on the needle; 1 double long treble
in the same chain stitch. This stitch is cast off so as to leave in
all 3 loops, and the cotton over the needle; these loops are cast
off together by drawing the cotton once through them. This forms 1
leaf, or one-half of the bell-shaped patterns. 3 purl, 1 chain, 1
leaf like the preceding one, 1 slip stitch in the 1st of the first
6 chain stitches; the other half of the pattern is then completed;
1 purl, 5 chain, 1 purl, 1 chain, 1 double in the middle stitch of
the next scallop of the preceding row, 1 purl, 5 chain, 1 purl, 1

the preceding row, 1 purl, 2 chain, 1 slip stitch in the following
purl, 1 purl (the 3 purl which are worked on the 3 purl of the

seen by the engraving when it is necessary to work a double long or
long stitch, or a stitch of single or double crochet, and the
number of chain stitches between must be just sufficient to make

and place them on it from the engraving, then sew them together,

<p>272 <em>and</em> 273.--<em>Work-Basket in Straw and Silk
Crochet-Work</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Straw; brown floss silk; brown ribbon, 1-1/4 inch
wide; small glass beads; a piece of bamboo cane.</p>

<p>This basket has a cover formed of two pieces. It can be employed
for <span class="newpage"><a name="page_266" id=
"page_266">[266]</a></span> many things, and is formed entirely of
crochet-work with brown silk over straw. A ruche trimmed with beads
and bows of brown silk ribbon form the trimming of the basket. The
straws over which you crochet must be damp, so as not to be stiff.
They should be of unequal length, and when you join the two ends of
two straws together, try to hide the beginning with the other
straws. Begin the basket in the centre of the bottom part with 46
stitches; then work 9 rounds on either side of this first row,
working alternately 1 double stitch, 1 or 2 chain stitches, the
double stitch in the chain stitch of the preceding round, the last
round over wire.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_267" id=
"page_267">[267]</a></span>

<center><a name="image_272"><img alt="Bottom of Work Basket (272)."
src="images/image272.jpg"></a></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_268" id=
"page_268">[268]</a></span>

<p>It is necessary to increase regularly in all the rounds to keep
the work flat. When you have finished the bottom begin the border
of the basket, which is worked of the same piece with it, and
consists of 11 rounds.</p>

<p>It is worked in the same way as the bottom, the first 2 rounds
without increasing the number of stitches, but in the following 9
rounds increase 2 double stitches at both ends, in order that the
edge may be a little wider in the upper part. In the last round add
a piece of wire to the straws.</p>

<center><a name="image_273"><img alt=
"Work Basket in Straw and Crochet." src=
"images/image273.jpg"></a></center>

<p>The cover of the basket is formed of two pieces. Begin in the
middle with 28 stitches; crochet each half in rows forming a half
circle, working backwards and forwards; at the beginning of each
row turn the straws, and take care that the rows which are finished
form a straight line. Each half of the cover requires 9 rows; the
last one is worked over wire. The two halves are united at the
straight sides by a brown silk ribbon 1-1/4 inch wide, which is
sewed on underneath, and which forms a sort of hinge; sew on also a
piece of wire covered with brown silk, so as to make the hinge
stronger. Form the handle with a piece of bamboo cane 23 inches
long, and covered with straws; work over it in long stitches of
brown silk, and let it go down to the bottom of the basket; then
sew the cover on the handle with the brown ribbon, which forms the
two parts. Trim the basket with a ruche of double box pleats,
ornamented with glass beads and with bows of brown silk ribbon.</p>

<p>274 <em>and</em> 275.--<em>Two Crochet Borders</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s crochet cotton Nos. 30
and 80.</p>

<p>No. 274.--Crochet cotton of two sizes is used for this border
(No. 30 and No. 80); it is begun in the centre by a chain of
stitches of the length required.</p>

<center><a name="image_274"><img alt="Crochet Border." src=
"images/image274.jpg"></a></center>

<p><em>1st row:</em> 1 double in each stitch of the chain.</p>



<p><em>2nd row:</em> Turn and work on the opposite side of the
chain, * 1 double, 11 chain, miss 7. Repeat from *. <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> * 1 double on the 1st loop of chain, 2 chain,
1 double in the centre of the 7 stitches which are under the 1st
loop of chain, 2 chain, 1 double on the same loop, 5 chain. Repeat
from *.</p>

<p><em>4th row:</em> * 1 double in the centre of the 1st loop of
chain, 3 chain, 1 treble in the 1st, but before you complete the
treble stitch make 1 chain. Repeat from *. This row completes the
upper half of the border. The lower half is worked over the 1st row
of plain double crochet.</p>

<p><em>5th row:</em> 1 double in each of the first 5 stitches, 15
chain, miss 9, 1 double, come back over the loop of chain and work
1 double in each stitch, come back again and work 6 small points,
each made thus: 5 chain, 1 double in the 4th, and 1 treble in each
of the 3 others, 1 double over the round scallop. When you have
worked the 6 small points repeat from *, but always join the 1st
point of one scallop to the last point of the next scallop. The
pattern inside the scallops is worked in 2 rows with fine cotton.
(See illustration.)</p>

<hr>
<br>


<center><a name="image_275"><img alt="Crochet Border." src=
"images/image275.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 275.--The border is begun above the pointed scallops, filled
up with lace stitches, by making alternately 3 chain, 1 purl
(<em>i.e</em>., 5 chain and 1 slip stitch in the 1st). When the
chain is long enough, turn and work <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_270" id="page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p><em>the 1st row:</em> Alternately 7 chain, 1 double in the
centre stitch between the 2 purl.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> Turn, work 1 double in the centre of the 1st
loop of 7 chain, 1 chain, 1 purl, 1 chain, 1 double in the centre
of next loop, and so on.</p>

<p>The 3rd row (which is the last) is worked on the opposite side
of the chain with purl. * In each of the 8 first stitches work 1
double, make 12 chain, miss the 4 last of the 8 double just worked,
and work 1 double in the 5th, come back over the loop of chain, and
work 7 small points over it. For each point make 3 chain, work 1
double in the 2nd, 1 treble in the 1st of the 3 chain, 1 double
upon the loop of chain. Repeat from * 6 times more.</p>

<p>In the following scallops always fasten the first point of one
scallop to the last point of the preceding scallop. When this row
is completed fill up the inner part of each scallop with a network
of fine thread, joining the threads at all the places where they
cross each other by 2 or 3 stitches with a sewing needle.</p>

<center><a name="image_276"><img alt="Crochet Antimacassar." src=
"images/image276.jpg"></a></center>

<p>This pattern can be adapted for a round couvrette or a square
one, and is also pretty done in silk for a sofa cushion. Make a
chain of 4 stitches, and unite it</p>

<p><em>1st round:</em> Work into 1 loop a long stitch, make 1 chain
stitch, work another long stitch into the same place, make 1 chain,
repeat.</p>

<p><em>2nd round:</em> 3 long stitches into 1 loop, make 2 chain
stitches, miss 1 loop, and repeat. <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_272" id="page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p><em>3rd round:</em> 1 double crochet into the 2 chain in last
round, make 7 chain, and repeat.</p>

<p><em>4th round:</em> Into the 7 chain 2 double crochet, 5 long
stitches, and 2 more double crochet, and repeat.</p>

<p><em>5th round:</em> 1 long stitch into the 1st double crochet in
last round, make 9 chain, and repeat.</p>

<p><em>6th round:</em> Into the 9 chain 2 double crochet, * make 4
chain, work 2 double crochet, repeat from * 3 times more, make 5
chain, work a stitch of single crochet into the 2nd of the 5, make
1 chain stitch, and repeat from the beginning of the round.</p>

<p><em>7th round:</em> 1 long stitch into the loop formed with the
5 chain, make 12 chain, and repeat.</p>

<p><em>8th round:</em> Into the 12 chain 2 double crochet into
successive loops, make 4 chain, work 1 double crochet into each of
the 2 next loops, make 1 chain, work into the 6th loop 1 double
crochet, 5 long stitches, and another double crochet, make 1 chain,
miss 1 loop, work 2 double crochet into successive loops, make 4
chain, work 1 double crochet into each of the 2 next, make 5 chain,
and repeat. This completes the circle. 120 circles sewn together
like the engraving will make a good-sized couvrette, 12 in the
length, and 10 in the width. If a round couvrette is wished, work 1
circle for the centre larger than the others; this can be done by
repeating the 5th and 6th rounds, then sew 8 circles round the
centre one, and increase the number of circles in each row till you
have made it the size you wish. For the square one, tassels are
required for the end and sides; these are made by winding the
cotton over a cardboard 4 inches deep about 80 times, then twist 8
threads of the cotton into a cord, cut the cotton wound on the
cardboard at one end, make 2 inches of the cord into a loop and tie
it firmly with the middle of the tassel, then turn it, tie a thread
tightly round, about an inch below the cord, and net over the head;
40 of these tassels will be sufficient.</p>

<p>The patterns of this insertion are worked in a row, and always
two opposite circles at a time. Make a foundation chain of 16
stitches, join them into a circle, then work a 2nd circle
consisting again of 16 chain stitches. Work round this circle 24
double stitches, and 24 double round the 1st circle; after the last
stitch begin again at the 2nd circle, and work 10 chain scallops as
follows:--3 double in the next 3 stitches, * 5 chain, 2 double in
the next 2 stitches, repeat 8 times more, 3 double in the last 3
stitches; work in the same manner round the other circle. To get to
the next pattern, work 4 slip stitches between the 2 circles in the
middle of the just-completed pattern, leaving the cotton under the
work and drawing it through the stitch upwards through the loop on
the needle; 7 chain stitches, and then 2 circles like those just
described, and so on.</p>

<p>This trimming consists of 2 strips of crochet insertion,
ornamented with embroidery patterns worked in appliqu&eacute;, and
velvet ribbon drawn through. They are worked the long way with fine
crochet cotton. Begin on a sufficiently long foundation chain of
stitches which can be divided by 20, and work the<em>1st row:</em>
1 chain, * 5 double, on the first 5 stitches of the foundation, 1
leaf, as follows:--10 chain, without reckoning the loop left on the
needle, 1 extra long treble (for which the cotton is <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_279" id="page_279">[279]</a></span> wound 5
times round the needle) in the second of the 10 chain, a similar
treble in the first, then cast off the 2 treble stitches together,
wind the cotton once round the needle, and cast off the last loop
with the loop left on the needle. Miss under the leaf 15 stitches
of the foundation, and repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> 5 double on the 5 double of the preceding row,
inserting the needle in the whole stitches, 15 chain stitches
between.</p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> * 5 double in the first 5 double of the

stitches; repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>4th row:</em> * 1 double in the middle of the 5 double of
the preceding row, 3 chain, 1 slip stitch in the middle stitch of
each of the 8 scallops, consisting of 7 chain in the preceding row,
3 chain between, 3 chain; repeat from *. These 2 last rows (the
third and fourth) are repeated on the other side of the foundation
chain.</p>

<p>When the 2 strips of insertion are completed, sew them together
so that 2 opposite scallops meet, and ornament them with the
embroidery patterns and velvet ribbon.</p>

<p>283.--<em>Crochet Insertion</em>.</p>

<p>This pretty insertion is very suitable for cerceaunette covers
or pillowcases, and should be worked with middle-sized cotton. If
the insertion is used for anything but a pillowcase, omit the lower
border on which the button-holes are made. Begin the insertion in
the middle of one of the star-like figures, with a foundation chain
of 9 stitches; join them into a circle by making 1 slip stitch, and
crochet thus:--* <span class="newpage"><a name="page_280" id=
"page_280">[280]</a></span> 10 chain, 1 slip stitch in the 5th of
these chain; this forms 1 purl; 4 chain, 1 slip stitch in the
circle, repeat from * 5 times more. Work 4 slip stitches in the
next 4 chain, then crochet * in the next purl; 5 double divided by
5 chain, 4 chain, repeat 5 times from *. Fasten the thread after
having fastened the last 4 chain-stitches with a slip stitch to the
1st double stitch of this round. This completes the star-like
figure. Work on one side of these figures the following rows:--</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> * 1 treble in the 2nd scallop of the four
placed together, 3 chain, 1 double in the next scallop, 3 chain, 1
treble in the last of the 4 scallops, 3 chain, 1 treble in the 1st
scallop of the following 4 placed together, 3 chain, 1 double in
the next 2nd scallop, 3 chain, 1 treble in the 3rd scallop, 3
chain. Repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> 3 treble in the 1st stitch of the preceding
row, * miss 3 stitches, 3 treble in the 4th following stitch.
Repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> * 3 treble cast off together as one stitch on
the next 3 stitches of the preceding row, 2 chain. Repeat from
*.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_281" id=
"page_281">[281]</a></span>

<p><em>4th row:</em> 1 double on the next stitch of the preceding
row, * 4 chain, 1 slip stitch in the 3 double; this forms 1 purl; 3
double on the next 3 stitches of the preceding row. Repeat from *.
After having worked these four rows likewise on the other side of
the star figures, work over the last the following 5 rows for the
button-holes:--</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> 1 double in the next purl, * 2 chain, 1 double
in the next purl. Repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> 1 double in each stitch of the preceding
row.</p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> Alternately 11 double, 7 chain, under which
miss 7 stitches.</p>

<p><em>4th row:</em> Like the 2nd row.</p>

<p><em>5th row;</em> * 3 double on the next 3 double of the
preceding row, 1 purl (4 chain, 1 slip stitch in the last double
stitch). Repeat from *.</p>

<p>284.--<em>Crochet Insertion</em>.</p>

<p>Material: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s crochet cotton No.
30.</p>

<p>This insertion is worked in our pattern with fine crochet cotton
on a double foundation chain. For the outer edge work a row of purl
stitches as follows:--1 double in the 1st stitch, * 1 chain, 1
purl, consisting of 5 chain, 1 slip stitch in the 1st 2 chain, 1
double in the next stitch but 2; repeat from *. The open-work
centre consists of 6 rows of scallops; the 1st of these rows is
worked on the other side of the foundation chain; 1 double in the
middle stitch of every scallop, 5 chain between, then 1 row of slip
stitches, and finally a row of purl <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_282" id="page_282">[282]</a></span> stitches like the 1st row
of the insertion. For the raised flowers, which are fastened over
the grounding at unequal distances, * make a foundation chain of 10
stitches, fasten it on over the grounding from illustration by
taking the needle out of the loop, inserting it into the 1 chain of
the grounding, and drawing the loop through; miss the last of the
10 chain, and work back over the others; 1 slip stitch, 1 double, 1
long double, 3 treble, 1 long double, 1 double, 1 slip stitch, then
1 slip stitch in the 1st stitch, * 9 chain, missing 5 stitches
under them, 1 double in the 6th stitch; repeat from *. Each
following row consists of 1 double in the middle stitch of every
scallop of the preceding row, 9 chain between. Then work the 1st
row of the border on the other side of the insertion; 1 double in
the 1st stitch of the foundation, inserting the needle into the
back part of the stitch; repeat 8 times more from *, and the flower
is completed.</p>

<p>285.--<em>Crochet Garter</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Grey thread of medium size; fine red wool; fine round
white elastic cord; a pearl button.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_283" id=
"page_283">[283]</a></span>

<p>This garter is worked in close double crochet, over fine elastic
cord; the border and pattern in red wool, the centre in grey
thread.</p>

<center><a name="image_285"><img alt="Crochet Garter." src=
"images/image285.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Begin in the middle by a chain of 98 stitches, with red wool;
take the elastic cord, which must always be stretched out a little,
and work over it. Work on both sides of the foundation chain; the
pattern is completed in the course of the two first rounds; the
button-hole is made at the beginning of the first round; make a
loop of 21 stitches, and, when you come to it, work over this loop
instead of over the foundation chain. Increase the number of
stitches at either end of the garter, to round it off. When the
second round is completed work two plain grey rounds, then a plain
red one. The last round (grey thread) is composed of alternately 1
double, 1 purl formed of 3 chain, 1 slip stitch in the first,
missing 1 stitch under the 1 purl. Sew on a pearl button to
correspond with the button-hole. The garter would be both more
elegant and more elastic if worked entirely in silk.</p>

<p>286.--<em>Crochet Trimming for a Lady's Chemise</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s crochet cotton, and a
needle to match.</p>

<p>This pattern, as can be seen in illustration, is an imitation of
old guipure lace; it is worked all in one piece for the bosom and
sleeves, and is part of one of the shoulder-pieces in full size.
Both strips of rosettes join at that place, and one is continued
for the part round the bosom and the other for the sleeve. In the
pattern there are 42 rosettes round the bosom, and 14 round each
sleeve. These rosettes are fastened one to another in the course of
the work. They are made in the following manner:--Make a chain of 6
stitches, and join it into a ring.</p>

<p><em>1st round:</em> 8 chain, 1 slip stitch in the 4th chain,
which forms a purl (the 3 first chain are reckoned as 1 treble), 1
chain, 1 treble in the ring, * 5 chain, 1 slip stitch in the 1st to
form a purl, 1 chain, 1 treble in the ring. Repeat 6 times from *.
Instead of the last treble, work a slip stitch to fasten the end of
the round to the 3 chain of the beginning, which thus form 1
treble.</p>

<p><em>2nd round:</em> 9 chain (the 3 first to be reckoned as 1
treble), * 1 treble on the 1st treble of last round, 6 chain.
Repeat 6 times from *. 1 slip stitch in the treble at the
beginning.</p>

<p><em>3rd round:</em> On each scallop of preceding round work 2
double, 1 purl, 2 double, 1 purl, 2 double, 1 purl, 2 double. This
completes the rosette. Each rosette is fastened to the last by
joining the 2 middle purl of both. In the illustration, which is
full-size, the purl that are to be joined to those of another
rosette are marked by a cross. The joining between the part round
the bosom and the sleeve is made in the same manner. The space left
between 4 rosettes is filled up with a star formed of chain
stitches, marked in our illustration with an asterisk. For this
star make a chain of 5 stitches, the 1st of which forms the <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_285" id="page_285">[285]</a></span>
centre; slip the loop you have on the needle through one of the 8
purl that are free, make 5 chain, 1 double in the centre stitch.
Repeat 7 times from *; then tie the two ends tightly, or sew them
together 3 of these stars are required for each shoulder.</p>

<center><a name="image_286"><img alt=

"images/image286.jpg"></a></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_286" id=
"page_286">[286]</a></span>

<p>For the Border.--It is worked at the same time both round the
bosom and sleeves.</p>

<p><em>1st round:</em> * 1 double in the centre purl of the 1st
scallop of the rosette, which we will call the <em>first
rosette</em>; 5 chain, 1 double in the centre purl of the 2nd
scallop of the same rosette, 4 chain; then work the kind of cross
which comes between each rosette (see illustration). To make this
cross throw the cotton 3 times round the needle, work 1 double
treble in the last purl left free of the 1st rosette, keep the last
loop on the needle, throw the cotton twice round it, and work a
double treble in the 1st purl left free in the 2nd rosette, throw
the thread twice round the needle, work 1 treble with the loop left
on the needle, make 2 chain, and work 1 treble in the last double
treble, which completes the cross; make 4 chain. Repeat from * at
each slit on the shoulders; after the last cross make 6 chain, 1
slip stitch in the 2 purl at the end of the slit, 6 chain to come
to the next space, where a cross is to be made.</p>

<p><em>2nd round:</em> Work alternately 1 treble, 2 chain, miss 2;
at the slit on the shoulders work 6 double over the 6 chain. The
two rounds just explained are also worked round the upper edge, and
finished round the sleeves by the following round:--1 double in one
of the spaces in last round, * 6 chain, 1 double in the 2nd of the
6 chain, which forms a purl, 1 chain, 1 double on the next but one
of the last round, 6 chain, 1 double in the 2nd of the 6 chain, 1
chain, 1 double in the next space. Repeat from *. On the upper edge
of the bosom, between the 1st and 2nd rounds of the border, work 1
round of crosses, but throwing the cotton twice only round the
needle, so that the treble stitches are not double; make 3 chain
between each cross.</p>

<h2>KNITTING</h2>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_288" id=
"page_288">[288]</a></span> <a name="KNITTING_INSTRUCTIONS"></a>

<h3>KNITTING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_289" id=
"page_289">[289]</a></span>

<p>287.--KNITTING, though considered to be an old-fashioned art, is
by no means so ancient as lacemaking. Knitting has never entirely
quitted the hands of English and German ladies; indeed, among all
good housewives of any civilised country, it is reckoned an
indispensable accomplishment. Knitting schools have been
established of late years both in Ireland and Scotland, and Her
Majesty the Queen has herself set an example of this industry, as
well as largely patronised the industrial knitters of Scotland. Of
the rudiments of this useful art many ladies are at present
ignorant; it is in the hope of being useful to these that the
following instructions are offered.</p>

<p>To knit, two, three, four, or five needles, and either thread,
cotton, silk, or wool are required.</p>

<p>Knitting needles are made of steel, of ivory, or of wood; the
size to be used depends entirely upon the material employed,
whether thread, cotton, silk, single or double wool, for knitting.
As the size of the needles depends upon that of the cotton, a
knitting gauge is used (see No. 287). The gauge (page 290) is the
exact size of Messrs. H. Walker and Co.'s knitting gauge. Our
readers will remark that English and foreign gauges differ very
essentially; the finest size of German <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_290" id="page_290">[290]</a></span> needles, for
example, is No. 1, which is the size of the coarsest English wooden
or ivory needle. Straight knitting is usually done with two needles
only for round knitting for socks, stockings, &amp;c., three, four,
and five needles are employed.</p>

<center><a name="image_287"><img alt="-Knitting Gauge." src=
"images/image287.jpg"></a></center>

<hr>
<br>


<p>288.--<em>Casting On</em>.</p>

<p>This term is used for placing the first row or round of knitting
stitches on the needles--"casting them on"--and is done in two
ways--by "knitting on" the stitches, or as follows:--</p>

<p>Hold the thread between the first and second finger of the left
hand, throw it over the thumb and first finger so as to form a
loop, and pass the needle in the loop; throw the thread lightly
round the needle, pass it through the loop, and draw up the thread;
this forms the first stitch (see No. 288).</p>

<center><a name="image_288"><img alt="Casting On." src=
"images/image288.jpg"></a></center>

<p>289.--<em>To Knit On</em>.</p>

<center><a name="image_289"><img alt="Knitting On." src=
"images/image289.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Take the needle on which the stitches are cast in the left hand,
and another needle in the right hand--observe the position of the
hands <span class="newpage"><a name="page_291" id=
"page_291">[291]</a></span> (No. 289). Hold the left-hand needle
between the thumb and third finger, leaving the first finger free
to move the points of the needles. (The wonderful sense of touch in
the first or index finger is so delicate, that an experienced
knitter can work without ever looking at her fingers, by the help
of this touch only--in fact, knitting becomes a purely mechanical
labour, and as such is most useful.) Insert the point of the
right-hand needle in the loop or stitch formed on the left-hand
needle, bring the thread once round, turning the point of the
needle in <span class="newpage"><a name="page_292" id=
"page_292">[292]</a></span> front under the stitch, bringing up the
thread thrown over, which in its turn becomes a stitch, and is
placed on the left-hand needle.</p>

<p>290.--<em>Simple Knitting (plain)</em>.</p>

<center><a name="image_290"><img alt="Plain Knitting." src=
"images/image290.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Pass the right-hand needle into the 1st stitch of the left-hand
needle, at the back throw the thread forward, and with the first
finger pass the point of the needle under the stitch in forming a
fresh stitch with the thread already thrown over, as in "knitting
on," only, instead of placing the newly-formed stitch on the
left-hand needle, leave it on the right-hand needle, and let the
stitch drop off the point of the left-hand needle. Continue thus
until all the stitches are taken from the left to the right-hand
needle, and the row is then complete.</p>

<p>291.--<em>To Purl, Pearl, or Seam</em>.</p>

<p>Seaming or purling a stitch is done by taking up the stitch
<em>in front</em> instead of at the back, throwing the thread over
and knitting the stitch as in plain knitting; but before beginning
to purl, the thread must be brought in front of the needle, and if
a plain stitch follows, the thread is passed back after the purl
stitch is made (see No. 291).</p>

<center><a name="image_291"><img alt="Purling." src=
"images/image291.jpg"></a></center>

<p>292.--<em>To Increase</em>. <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_293" id="page_293">[293]</a></span> Increasing or making a
stitch is done by throwing the thread once round the needle and in
the next row knitting it as an ordinary stitch.</p>

<center><a name="image_292"><img alt="Increasing." src=
"images/image292.jpg"></a></center>

<p>293.--<em>To Decrease</em>.</p>

<p>This is done in two ways: <em>firstly</em>, taking up two
stitches and knitting them together as one; <em>secondly</em>, by
taking up a stitch without knitting it, called slipping, then by
knitting the following stitch in the usual way, and then slipping
the 1st (unknitted) over the 2nd (knitted) (see No. 293). When it
is necessary to decrease two stitches at once, proceed thus:--Slip
one, knit two stitches together, then slip the unknitted stitch
over the two knitted together.</p>

<center><a name="image_293"><img alt="Decreasing." src=
"images/image293.jpg"></a></center>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_294" id=
"page_294">[294]</a></span>

<p>294.--<em>Round Knitting</em>.</p>

<p>To knit a round four or five needles are used; it is thus that
stockings, socks, cuffs, mittens, &amp;c., are made. To knit with
four needles, cast on, say, 32 stitches upon one needle, insert a
second needle in the last stitch of the first, and cast on 30
stitches; proceed in a similar way with a third needle, but casting
on 28 only; when this is done, knit the two extra stitches on the
first needle on to the last; this makes 30 stitches upon each
needle, and completes the round.</p>

<p>295.--<em>Casting Off</em>.</p>

<p>Knit two stitches, and with the left-hand needle slip the first
stitch over the second; continue this to the end of the row.
<em>Note</em>.--The last knitted row, before casting off, should be
knitted loosely. <span class="newpage"><a name="page_295" id=
"page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>296.--<em>To Pick up a Stitch</em>.</p>

<p>This is done by taking up the thread between two stitches and
forming a stitch with it.</p>

<hr>
<br>


<p>The following Designs of New Stitches can be used for a variety
of work:--</p>

<p>297.--<em>Peacock's Tail Pattern</em>.</p>

<p>Needles, wood or ivory; Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s knitting
cotton.</p>

<center><a name="image_297"><img alt="Peacock's Tail Pattern." src=
"images/image297.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Cast on a number of stitches divisible by nine, as it takes nine
stitches for each pattern, and two for each border; the border,
which <span class="newpage"><a name="page_296" id=
"page_296">[296]</a></span> is in plain knitting, will not be
mentioned after the first row.</p>

<p>1<em>st Row</em>.--2 plain for border; 2 plain *, make 1, 1
plain, repeat this four times from *, make 1, 2 plain; repeat from
the beginning--then 2 plain for border.</p>

<p>2<em>nd Row</em>.--2 purl, 11 plain, 2 purl; repeat.</p>

<center><a name="image_298"><img alt="Spiral Stitch." src=
"images/image298.jpg"></a></center>

<p>3<em>rd Row</em>.--Take 2 together, 11 plain, take 2 together;
repeat.</p>

<p>4<em>th Row</em>.--Purl 2 together, purl 9, purl 2 together;
repeat.</p>

<p>5<em>th Row</em>.--Take 2 together, 7 plain, take 2
together.</p>

<p>Begin from the 1st row.</p>

<p>Thirteen stitches are large enough for a stripe for a
sofa-cover. These stripes should be sewn together after all are
finished.</p>

<hr>
<br>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page_297" id=
"page_297">[297]</a></span>

<p>298.--<em>Spiral Stitch</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Needles, thick steel or bone; double wool.</p>

<p>This stitch is far more effective worked in thick wool than in
cotton. It is done in stripes alternately wide and narrow. For wide
stripes cast on twenty-one stitches, for narrow fifteen; this

<p>299.--<em>Knotted Stitch</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Needles, wood or ivory; double wool.</p>

<p>Cast on 11 stitches.</p>

<p><em>1st Row</em>.--All plain, throwing the wool twice round the
needle before each stitch.</p>

<p><em>2nd Row</em>.--Each stitch on the needle is now composed of
3 threads of wool: knit the first plain, the second purl, the third
plain; cast off the second over the third, and the first over the
second; this leaves but one stitch; repeat from first row until a
sufficient length is obtained. This pattern makes very pretty
borders.</p>

<p>300.--<em>Knitted Moss Borders</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Steel needles; moss wool of several shades of
green.</p>

<p>Cast on enough stitches for double the width required, say
twenty, and knit very tightly in plain knitting, row by row, until
a sufficient length has been obtained. Cut off and place the strip
on a sieve over a basin of boiling water, and cover it over. When
it has absorbed the steam, and while wet, iron it with a box-iron.
Then cut the strip down the centre, and unravel the wool on each
side. The threads of wool all curling, resemble moss. They are held
firmly by the selvedge of the knitting.</p>

"NETTING_INSTRUCTIONS"></a>

<h3>NETTING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<p>302.--NETTING is one of the prettiest and one of the easiest
accomplishments of a lady. The materials are simple, while the
effects produced by good netting are most elegant and of great
durability. One great advantage of netting is that each stitch is
finished and independent of the next, so that if an accident
happens to one stitch it does not, as in crochet or knitting, spoil
the whole work.</p>

<p>Netting, so easy to do, is most difficult to describe. The
materials required are--a netting-needle and mesh (see illustration
No. 302). These are made of bone, of wood, of ivory, and most
commonly of steel. The wood, bone, and ivory are only used for
netting wool, the steel for silk, cotton, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The needle is filled by passing the end of the thread through
the little hole at the left-hand point, and tying it; then the
thread is wound on the needle as on a tatting shuttle. The needles
are numbered from 12 to 24; these last are extremely fine. The
meshes correspond to the sizes of the needles, and are made of the
same materials. The larger the size of the stitch required the
thicker the mesh must be selected; indeed, large hat meshes are
often used for some patterns. A stirrup to slip over the foot to
which the foundation is attached is required by those who do <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_302" id="page_302">[302]</a></span>
not use a netting cushion, placed before them on the table and
heavily weighted; to this the foundation is fastened.</p>

<p>The stirrup is made of a loop of ribbon, to which the foundation
is tied. Some ladies work a pretty stirrup of the exact shape of a
horseman's stirrup; a loop of ribbon is passed through this, and
the foundation fixed as before.</p>

<center><a name="image_302"><img alt="Needle and Mesh." src=
"images/image302.jpg"></a></center>

<p>303.--<em>To Net</em>.</p>

<p>Place the mesh under the thread, between the thumb and finger of
the left hand; it must rest on the middle of the finger and be held
only by the thumb (see illustration No. 303). Take the needle in
the right hand, pass the thread over the middle and ring finger and
over the mesh, pass the needle upwards and behind the mesh in the
large loop which forms the thread round the fingers, and at the
same time through the first stitch or loop of the foundation. Draw
the needle out, retaining the loops on the fingers and dropping
them off, the little finger being the last to release the thread.
As the thread tightens and the knot is firm, the loop on the little
finger should be drawn up quickly and smartly. The next stitches
are precisely similar, and row upon row is formed in the <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_303" id="page_303">[303]</a></span>
same manner. Having learnt the stitch, the next task is to make a
foundation. Tie a large loop of strong thread on the stirrup
ribbon, and net fifty stitches into this loop, then net four or
five rows, and the foundation is ready.</p>

<center><a name="image_303"><img alt="Netting." src=
"images/image303.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Simple netting as above explained forms diamonds or lozenges.
When a piece of netting is finished it is cut off the foundation,
and the little ends of thread that held the stitches are drawn
out.</p>

<p>304.--<em>Square Netting</em>.</p>

<p>Is done precisely in the same manner as plain netting, only
begin from one stitch, then net two stitches into this first, and
increase by making two in the last loop of every row. As soon as
the right number of stitches is complete diminish exactly in the
same way by netting two stitches as one at the end of each row
until one stitch alone remains. These squares are used for guipure
d'art and for darning on.</p>

<p>305.--<em>Round Netting</em></p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_304" id=
"page_304">[304]</a></span>

<p>Is nearly similar to plain netting. A little difference exists
in the way of passing the needle through the stitch; this is shown
in No. 305. After having passed the needle through the stitch it is
drawn out and passed from above into the loop just made. This
stitch is very effective for purses.</p>

<center><a name="image_305"><img alt="Round Netting." src=
"images/image305.jpg"></a></center>

<p>306.--<em>Diamond Netting</em></p>

<p>Is often called "pointed netting," and is made by netting from
one stitch, increasing one stitch at the end of each row, and
decreasing in the same way, as described at page 303.</p>

<p>307.--<em>To Net Rounds</em>.</p>

<p>To form a circle, as for a purse, the needle must pass through
the first stitch, keeping the last three or four on the mesh and
removing this when required by the work. <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_305" id="page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>308.--<em>"English" Netting</em></p>

<p>Is made as follows:--Net a row of plain netting, begin the
second row by netting the second stitch, then net the first;
repeat, always passing by one stitch and taking it up.</p>

<p><em>3rd Row</em>--Plain.</p>

<p><em>4th Row</em>--Begin by a plain stitch, then continue as in
the 2nd row.</p>

<p><em>5th Row</em>--Plain.</p>

<center><a name="image_308"><img alt="English Netting." src=
"images/image308.jpg"></a></center>

<p>309.--<em>Lace Edging</em>.</p>

<p>Begin by one stitch and net two in one at the end of each row
until as many stitches are required for the narrowest part of the
edge. * Increase one then in the two loops until the point of the
edge or scallop is reached; at the next row leave the squares which
form the point, and begin from *.</p>

<p>310.--<em>Open Lace</em>.</p>

<p>This kind of edging is made with two meshes of different sizes
and extremely fine crochet cotton.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_306" id=
"page_306">[306]</a></span>

<p>Tie the thread to the foundation, net 3 rows with the small mesh
of the required length.</p>

<p><em>4th Row</em>--On the large mesh, one stitch in each
stitch.</p>

<p><em>5th Row</em>--On the small mesh take 3 stitches together to
form 1 loop; repeat to end of row.</p>

<p><em>6th Row</em>--On the large mesh make 5 loops in each stitch;
repeat to end of row.</p>

<center><a name="image_310"><img alt="Open Lace." src=
"images/image310.jpg"></a></center>

<p><em>7th Row</em>--On the small mesh, one loop in each of the 4
first stitches, pass over the 5th, repeat to end.</p>

<p><em>8th Row</em>--On the small mesh make a loop in each of the
two first stitches, pass over the 4th; repeat.</p>

<p><em>9th Row</em>--On the small mesh make a loop in each of the
two first stitches, pass over the 3rd; repeat.</p>

<p>This lace is often used in fine wool of two colours to trim
opera-caps, children's hoods, &amp;c.</p>

<p>311.--<em>Shell Border</em>.</p>

<p>This border is intended as an edging for square netting for
couvrettes, d'oyleys, &amp;c. The mesh must be three times as long
as that employed for the square netting.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_307" id=
"page_307">[307]</a></span>

<p>Make 12 stitches in the first stitch of the edge, pass over 8,
make 12 in the ninth, and repeat. Then take the mesh used for the
square netting, and net one stitch in each stitch, take a still
smaller mesh, and complete by adding another row of one stitch in
each stitch.</p>

<p>This border forms a very appropriate edging for all articles in
square netting, as couvrettes, mats, also for trimming guipure
d'art work, and should be netted in the row of holes edging the
work; two sets of shells must be worked at the corners when a
little fulness is required.</p>

<p>312.--<em>Knitted Sock for a Child.</em></p>

<p>Materials for 1 pair: 1 ounce of single Berlin wool; 1 yard of
narrow pink or blue ribbon; 2 fine steel pins.</p>

<p>This sock fits well, and is easy to make. It is knitted upon two
pins, backwards and forwards. Cast on 22 stitches and knit 22 rows,
but increase once at the end of every other row on the right side
of the work, so that there are 33 stitches in the 22nd row. Now
cast off 28 stitches and knit 12 rows, increasing 1 stitch at the
end of every other row. Now 12 more rows, decreasing 1 stitch at
the end of every other row; this forms the toe. Cast on 28 stitches
on the same needle, and knit 22 rows, decreasing 1 stitch at the
end of every other row, and cast off. Pick up the 68 stitches on
the upper part of shoe, and knit 20 rows, alternately 2 plain and 2
purl rows, decreasing 1 stitch on each side of the 12 stitches in
every other row, which forms the toe and front of sock. Knit 14
rows of 2 plain, 2 purl stitches alternately, then 3 open rows with
1 plain row between. <span class="newpage"><a name="page_310" id=
"page_310">[310]</a></span> The open rows are worked as follows:--*
Purl 2 together, purl 1, make 1, repeat *, 3 plain rows, 1 open
row, 1 plain row, and cast off. The sock is sewn together down the
back of leg, centre of sole, and the point joined like a gusset to
form the toe.</p>

<p>314.--<em>Knitted Sleeping Sock.</em></p>

<p>Materials for one pair: 4 ounces white fleecy, 3 ply; 1 ounces
light blue fleecy.</p>

<center><a name="image_314"><img alt="Knitted Sleeping Sock." src=
"images/image314.jpg"></a></center>

<p>These socks are knitted with white and blue wool in a diamond
pattern, and in rounds like a stocking. Begin at the upper part of
the sock; cast on 103 stitches with blue wool on pretty thick steel
knitting-needles, and knit 20 rounds of the diamond pattern as
follows:--</p>

<p><em>1st round:</em> Quite plain.</p>

<p><em>2nd round:</em> Purled; both these rounds are worked with
blue wool.</p>

<p><em>3rd to 6th rounds:</em> Knitted plain with white wool.</p>

<p><em>7th round:</em>With blue wool; knit 3, draw the wool through
the next stitch of the 2nd round worked with blue wool, draw it out
as a loop, keep it on the needle, knit again 3 stitches, and so on.
8th round: With blue wool; the loop which has been taken up on the
preceding round is purled off together with the preceding stitch.
Repeat the 3rd and 8th rounds <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_315" id="page_315">[315]</a></span> twice more; the loop of
one round must be placed between those of the preceding one. Then
knit with white wool 31 rounds, alternately 2 stitches knitted, 2
stitches purled, then work the foot in the diamond pattern in the
same way as usual for a stocking. The heel is formed by leaving 23
stitches on each side the seam stitch, and knitted backwards and
forwards in the diamond pattern. At the toe decrease so that the
decreasings form a seam on both sides of the toe. This is obtained
by knitting the 3rd and 4th stitches of the 1st needle together; on
the 2nd needle slip the 4th stitch before the last, knit the next
stitch and draw the slipped stitch over the knitted one; decrease
in the same manner on the other 2 needles of this round. Repeat
these decreasings <span class="newpage"><a name="page_316" id=
"page_316">[316]</a></span> exactly in the same direction and at
the same places, so that there are always 4 stitches between the 2
decreasings at the end and at the beginning of 2 needles; they
always take place after 3 or 2 plain rounds, and at last after 1
plain round. The remaining stitches are knitted off 2 and 2
together. To complete the sock, the outline of the sole is marked
by working slip stitches with blue wool in crochet all round it;
work also slip stitches on the selvedge stitch of the heel. The
stocking is finished off at the top with a double round of loops in
blue wool, worked over a mesh four-fifths of an inch wide.</p>

<p><em>315 and 316.--Netted Fichu or Cape.</em></p>

<p>Material: Fine wool, or white and blue silk; netting needle and
meshes.</p>

<p>This fichu or cape is made either with fine wool or with silk
used three or four times double. It may be worn as an evening wrap,
either over a cap or on the hair, or as a necktie. The ground in
our pattern is white, the border blue. The illustration of the
ground and of the border, in full size, will serve as a guide for
the size of the meshes to be used. For the ground cast on the first
mesh, with white silk, 56 stitches; work 2 rows on the 56 stitches.
From the 3rd row, always miss the last stitch, so that each row is
decreased 1 stitch. Continue in this manner till the 39th row, when
there will be but 19 stitches left. From the 40th row, miss 2
stitches at the end of each row. The ground is completed with the
46th row. The 1st row of the work is the <em>cross-way side</em>;
the last, the <em>point at the bottom</em>; fasten on the blue silk
to the 1st stitch of the 1st row, and on a larger mesh work 1 row
round the ground of the fichu, not forgetting that the stitch on
the outer edge at the sides must always be taken, and 2 stitches
made in the 5th, 10th, 14th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, and 25th stitches at
the sides, as well as in each of the 2 middle stitches of the last
row; in each of the other stitches 1 stitch should be made. On the
corners of the sides increase <em>once</em>, on the cross-way side,
seven times in all.</p>

<p>This purse is knitted with black and scarlet purse silk, and
ornamented with black beads and a black bead tassel. Begin the
purse with the black silk in the centre of the bottom part, and
cast on for one part of it 7 stitches. Knit 14 rows on these
backwards and forwards, in such a manner that the work is knitted
on one side and purled on the other. The 1st stitch of every row is
slipped, the 1st row of this part is purled. * On that side where
hangs the thread with which you work take the back chain of the 7
selvedge stitches of the part you have just knitted on a separate
needle, and knit another part, which must have 15 rows, and the 1st
row of which is knitted. Repeat 10 times more from *. The stitches
of several parts can be taken on the same needle, so as not to be
hindered in working by too many needles. When the 12th part is
completed, take the selvedge stitches on the left hand on another
needle, cast them off together with the cast on stitches of the 1st
part, and fasten the silk thread. Then take the 7 right-hand
selvedge stitches of one black part on a needle, take the red silk
on which the beads have been strung and work 15 rows on these
stitches, the 1st row from the wrong side, and therefore purled; in
the 1st, as well as in all the other purled rows, the last stitch
must be purled together with the next stitch of the next black
part. In the purled rows, moreover, <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_321" id="page_321">[321]</a></span> excepting in the first
and last one, a bead must be worked in after casting off the 2nd,
4th, and 6th stitches. The stitch must be worked by inserting the
needle into the back part, and in drawing through the silk which
has been thrown forward, let the bead slide through the stitch so
that it is on the right side of the work. In the following knitted
row, the needle must also be inserted into the back part of the
bead stitch. When 12 such red parts have been completed, work again
12 black parts on the selvedge stitch of the same, in which the
beads are not knitted in, but sewn on afterwards, when the purse is
completed. Then work 3 times more alternately 12 red and 12 black
parts; when the last 12 black parts have been completed cast off
the stitches of the last black part together with the selvedge
stitches, the 1st on the wrong side; the stitches of the 6th part
are cast off in the same manner together with the selvedge stitches
of the 7th. The red parts which remain to be worked on the black
part are thus lessened by 2; the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, and the 7th,
8th, and 9th of these parts must be by 6 rows longer. Then gather
all the stitches and selvedge stitches of the 10 parts on 2
needles, in such a manner that the 2 black parts, the stitches and
selvedge stitches of which have been cast off together, are placed
on the sides of the purse, and knit as follows with black silk,
first on the stitches of the one needle, and then on those of the
other:--1 row knitted, knitting together every 3rd and 4th stitch;
then work 3 rows backwards and forwards on the same number of
stitches, which must be knitted on the right side; then work 8 rows
more in the same manner, casting off the 2 first stitches of the 8
rows. Then cast off all the remaining stitches, sew the beads on
the black parts from illustration; also the clasp and bead
tassel.</p>

<p>318 to 320.--<em>Knitted Antimacassar or Berceaunelle
Cover.</em></p>

<p>Materials: Grey and violot fleecy wool.</p>

<center><a name="image_318"><img alt="Square for Antimacassar."
src="images/image318.jpg"></a></center>

<p>This antimacassar, part of which is seen on No. 320, smaller
than full size, is made of rosettes and small squares, which are
knitted separately with violet and grey fleecy wool with fine
knitting-needles. In the middle of each rosette sew on a tatted
circle of grey wool. The edge of the antimacassar is ornamented
with a grey woollen fringe. For each rosette cast on 6 stitches
with violet wool, and knit 12 rows backwards and forwards in such a
manner that the work is knitted on one side and purled on the
other: the first of these 12 rows is purled, the first stitch of
every row is slipped; * then take the first five selvedge stitches
of the knitted part on a separate needle (on the side where the end
of wool hangs down, leaving it unnoticed for the present),
inserting the needle into the back chain of the stitch (the
selvedge stitch which is next to the cast-on stitch remains,
therefore, unworked upon), and knit on these a new part, which must
have 13 rows; the first row is knitted, and in this row work 2
stitches in the first stitch, one purled and one knitted, so that
this new part is equally six stitches wide. Repeat 8 times more
from *. After having worked several parts, the stitches can, of
course, be taken on the same needle, so as not to increase the
number of needles. When the 10th part is completed, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_323" id="page_323">[323]</a></span> take
the selvedge stitches of the left-hand side of the same on a
separate needle, cast them off with the cast-on stitches of the
first part, and fasten the wool. Then take the 6 selvedge stitches
on the right hand of one part on a separate needle; take the grey
wool, and work on these stitches 13 rows backwards and forwards;
the first row is knitted; it is worked on the right side of the
work; in this, and in every following <em>knitted</em> row, knit
the last stitch together with the next stitch of the next violet
part. When 10 such grey parts are completed (each of the remaining
9 parts consists of 13 rows, and begins with one knitted row), take
all the stitches and the selvedge stitches of these parts on four
needles and knit with these stitches, also with <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_324" id="page_324">[324]</a></span> grey
wool 1 row knitted, in which the 6 selvedge stitches must be
decreased to 3 by knitting always 2 stitches together as 1 stitch;
each of the other stitches is knitted as usual. Then purl 2 rows
with violet wool, and cast off.</p>

<p>For the tatted circle in the centre of the rosette, work with
grey wool a circle consisting of 1 double, and 11 times alternately
1 purl 3-10ths of an inch long, 2 double, then 1 purl and 1 double.
The circle is sewn on the rosette, from illustration, with grey
wool. No. 319 shows such a rosette full size. The small squares
(<em>see</em> No. 318) are worked with <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_325" id="page_325">[325]</a></span> grey wool; cast on
36 stitches, join the stitches into a circle, and purl 2 rows. To
form the corners, knit together 4 times 2 stitches after every 7
stitches in the first of these two rounds, in the second round knit
together 2 stitches after every 6 stitches; these decreasings and
those of the other rounds must always take place, at the same
places as in the preceding round. Then take the violet wool, and
knit 7 rows; in the first of these knit 4 times 2 stitches together
after intervals of 5 stitches; no decreasings take place in the
2nd, 4th, and 6th rows; in the 3rd row knit together 4 times 3
stitches as 1 stitch, and in the 5th and 7th rows 4 times 2
stitches as 1 stitch. After the 7th round, the remaining stitches
are cast off together as 1 stitch. Then fasten the wool and cut it
off. Lastly, sew the rosettes and squares together from No. 320 for
a cover, and edge it round the border with a fringe of grey
wool.</p>

<p>321.--<em>Knitted Border.</em></p>

<p>Material: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s No. 10 or No. 50
knitting cotton.</p>

<p>If knitted with thick cotton, this border will be suitable for
trimming a quilt or berceaunette cover; if, on the contrary, fine
cotton is used, the pattern will form a very pretty collar for a
little boy or girl.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_326" id=
"page_326">[326]</a></span>

<p>To make a collar, begin by a chain of 220 stitches, and work 6
rows backwards and forwards alternately, knitting 4 stitches and
purling 2.</p>

<p>In the 2nd, 4th, and 6th rows the 4 stitches are purled, and the
2 are knitted.</p>

<p><em>7th row:</em> * Purl 2, make 1, knit 2, purl 2. Repeat from
*.</p>

<p><em>8th row:</em> Alternately purl 5, knit 2. All the rows with
<em>even</em> numbers are knitted like this, except that the number
of the knitted stitches are increased by 2 in each of them. We will
not, therefore, henceforth mention these rows.</p>

<p><em>9th row:</em> * Knit 2, make 1, knit 1, make 1, knit 2, purl
2. Repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>11th row:</em> * Knit 2, make 1, knit 3, make 1, knit 2,
purl 2. Repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>13th row:</em> * Knit 2, make 1, knit 5, make 1, knit 2,
purl 2. Repeat from *. The pattern is continued in the same manner.
The small gores formed between the ribs are increased by 2 stitches
in every second row. Each of these gores has 13 stitches in the
21st row, which is the last. Cast off all the stitches after this
row.</p>

<p>Take a crochet needle, and with the same cotton as that used for
the knitting work 1 stitch of double crochet in every stitch of the
selvedge, then the 2 following rows for the edging. 1st row:
Alternately 1 treble, 1 chain, under which miss 1.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> Alternately 1 double over 1 treble of
preceding row, 1 purl (that is, 5 chain and 1 slip stitch in the
first), under which miss 1. Over the first row of the knitting work
1 row of close double crochet. The border is now completed.</p>

<p>322.--<em>Knee-cap in Knitting.</em></p>

<p>Materials: For 1 pair, 4 oz. pink 4-thread fleecy wool, and a
small quantity of white ditto.</p>

<p>Begin each knee-cap by casting on with pink wool 114 stitches,
equally divided upon 4 needles, and joining them into a circle.
Upon this number of stitches work 47 rounds, alternately knitting
and purling 2 stitches. In the 48th round begin the gore which
covers the knee; it is worked separately backward and forwards,
always alternately knitting and purling 2 stitches.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_327" id=
"page_327">[327]</a></span>

<center><a name="image_322"><img alt="Knee-cap in Knitting." src=
"images/image322.jpg"></a></center>

<p>After 2 rows change the pattern, so as to form small squares
Knit the first row of this gore upon 26 stitches slipped off from
the last row on <span class="newpage"><a name="page_328" id=
"page_328">[328]</a></span> to a separate needle. At the end of
each following row knit the nearest stitch of the nearest needle,
so as to increase 1 stitch in each row of the gore.</p>

<p>Continue in this way until only 42 stitches remain of the ribbed
part. After this work the remainder of the gore separately,
decreasing once at the beginning and end of each row till only 26
stitches remain; then take up 23 stitches of the selvedge on each
side of these 26 stitches, and work 47 rounds, alternately knitting
and purling 2 stitches.</p>

<p>The edging at the top and bottom of the knee-cap is worked in
crochet. With white wool make a chain of 50 stitches; turn and work
1 row of crochet <em>&agrave; tricoter</em>; then work a second row
thus: the first part, as usual, with white, but coming back, with
pink make 4 chain between each stitch, work in the same way on the
other side of the foundation chain, thus forming a small ruche, and
sew it on to the edge of the knitting.</p>

<p>Material: Black Shetland wool.</p>

<p>This three-cornered neckerchief is knitted in the following
pattern (commencing at the corner).</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> slip 1, make 1, knit 2 together, inserting the
needle into the back part of the stitch, slip 1, make 1, knit 2
together.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> Knit 1, purl 1 in the stitch formed by
throwing the wool forward in the preceding row; the other stitches
are purled. In the next row the holes are alternated; the
neckerchief must of course be increased at the beginning and end of
every other row. It measures at the upper edge 1 yard 16 inches
across from one corner to the other; the lower corner is rounded
off. The neckerchief is edged with a knitted lace.</p>

<p><em>324 and 325.--Knitted Bodice without Sleeves.</em></p>

<p>Materials: 4 ounces black, 3-1/2 ounces purple fleecy; black
silk elastic; a steel buckle; 9 black bone buttons.</p>

<p>This bodice is knitted in brioche stitch with black and purple
wool, so <span class="newpage"><a name="page_332" id=
"page_332">[332]</a></span> that the raised ribs appear black on
one side and purple on the other. The bodice fits quite close. It
is fastened in front with black bone buttons and a steel buckle.
Two strips of silk elastic are knitted in at the bottom. Begin at
the bottom of the bodice with black wool, and cast on 170 stitches.
The needles must be rather fine, and the knitting not too loose.
Work backwards and forwards 24 rows as follows:--Slip the 1st
stitch, alternately throw the wool forward, slip 1 as if you were
going to purl it, and knit 1. In the next row knit together the
stitch which has been slipped and the stitch formed by throwing the
wool forward, slip the knitted stitch, after having thrown the wool
forward. In the 25th row take the purple wool and work 1 row as
before.</p>

<center><a name="image_325"><img alt=
"Knitted Bodice without Sleeves (Front)." src=
"images/image325.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Now work alternately 1 row with black wool and 1 row with
purple, but as the wool is not cut off, the brioche stitch must be
alternately knitted and purled. Work always 2 rows on the same side
from right to left. The following 26th row is worked with black
wool in common brioche stitch, only the slipped stitch of the
preceding row is purled together with the stitch formed by throwing
the wool forward. 27th row: Turn the work, with purple wool purled
brioche stitch. 28th row: On the same side with black wool knitted
brioche stitch. After having worked 40 rows all in the same manner,
begin the front gore. Divide the stitches upon three needles, 82
stitches on one needle for the back, and 44 stitches for <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_334" id="page_334">[334]</a></span>
each front part on the two other needles. Then work the first 11
stitches of the left front part (this row must be worked on that
side of the work upon which the ribs appear purple) in knitted
brioche stitch; the 11th stitch must have a slipped stitch, with
the wool thrown forward, therefore it is a purple rib. After this
stitch begin the gore with the following 13 stitches. The ribs are
then worked so that a purple one comes over a black one, and a
black one over a purple one. Do not work upon the following black
stitch; knit the following stitch with the one formed by throwing
the wool forward. Throw the wool forward, and then only slip the
black stitch which had been left, so that it comes behind the
stitch which has just been knitted. This crossing of the stitch is
repeated once more, then knit the following stitch together with
the one formed by throwing the wool forward, throw the wool
forward, slip the crossed black stitch and the two following single
black stitches. The slipped stitch and the stitch formed by
throwing the wool forward before the 3rd single black stitch are
then knitted together, so that the crossed stitches are placed in
opposite directions. The three black stitches which are knitted off
together as 1 stitch in the next row form the middle line of the
front gore, and are continued in a straight line to the point of
the gore. The crossing takes place twice in this row, but now the
black stitch is slipped first. After the 24th stitch knit together
the following stitch with the stitch formed by throwing the wool
forward. Then continue to work in common brioche stitch to the
other front part, where the gore begins before the 24th stitch from
the end. In the next row, which is worked in purled brioche stitch
with black wool, take up the black loop between two purple ribs
after the 11th stitch; purl it so as to form the stitch <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_335" id="page_335">[335]</a></span>
which is missing at that place. The 3 slipped stitches in the
preceding row are purled together as one stitch with the stitch
formed by throwing the wool forward between the ribs. The loop is
also taken up on the other side of the front gore in the same
manner, as well as on the other front part. Then work 6 rows
without increasing or decreasing. The crossing of the stitch is
repeated after every 7 rows, always on the knitted brioche stitch
side, with purple wool. In the 18th row of the gore the 3 middle
stitches are not knitted together, but separately, so that the
pattern must be decreased in 26 rows. In the back 30 stitches only
must be decreased, two in every 6th row. After the 60th row another
decreasing takes place on the outer edges of the front parts for
the neck; they decrease 2 stitches (1st rib) after the 5th stitch
from the front edge in every 3rd row. The 5 stitches which close to
the neck are cast off together with the 5 stitches on the
shoulders. Then cast off loosely the stitches of the back; take all
the selvedge stitches of the front on the needles, and knit 24 rows
of brioche stitch with black wool, making 9 button-holes on the
right front part. On the wrong side of this part sew on a strip of
black silk, with slits worked round in button-hole stitch,
stitching at the same time into the knitting. The following
scallops are knitted round the top of the jacket and round the
armholes with black wool:--Take the selvedge stitches on the
needles, work 4 rows alternately, 1 stitch knitted, 1 stitch
purled, thread the wool into a Berlin wool-work needle, * cast off
3 stitches together, draw the wool through the needle, and take the
2 following stitches on the wool in the worsted-needle; repeat from
*. Sew on the buttons the strips of silk elastic on either side of
the black stripe at the bottom, and fasten the ends of the latter
with the steel buckle.</p>

"page_337">[337]</a></span> stitch; in the following rounds take
care to purl the slipped stitches.</p>

<center><a name="image_326"><img alt="Baby's Boot." src=
"images/image326.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Take now 18 stitches for the front gored sock part (leave 30
stitches untouched), and work backwards and forwards with red
wool.</p>

<p><em>48th to 50th row:</em> With red wool.</p>

<p><em>48th row:</em> Knitted.</p>

<p><em>49th row:</em> Purled.</p>

<p><em>50th row:</em> Knitted.</p>

<p><em>51st to 85th row:</em> With white wool in the pattern
described in the 39th round. But as you work backwards and forwards
you must alternately knit <span class="newpage"><a name="page_338"
id="page_338">[338]</a></span> and purl the stitches. Decrease 1
stitch at the beginning and at the end of the 84th and 85th rows;
decrease 1 stitch in the middle of the 85th row, so that the 85th
row has 13 stitches left. After this work with red wool.</p>

<p><em>86th row:</em> Knitted.</p>

<p><em>87th row:</em> Knit 1, purl 2, knit 1, purl 2, knit 1, purl
2, knit 1, purl 2, knit 1.</p>

<p>Repeat these last 2 rows 3 times more and knit plain to the
94th, decreasing one, however, on each side. Now work with the
whole number of stitches, taking up the selvedge stitches of the
gored part and dividing them with the 30 other stitches on four
needles. Knit once more in rounds; the next 20 rounds are
alternately 1 round knitted, 1 round purled. In the 2 last knitted
rounds decrease twice close together in the middle of the back part
of the shoe. Knit 8 rounds; in every other round decrease twice in
the middle of the front of the shoe, leaving 9 stitches between the
two decreasings. The number of stitches between the decreasings
decreases with every round, so that the decreasings form slanting
lines meeting in a point. Cast off after these 8 rounds, by
knitting together 2 opposite stitches on the wrong side. The sock
part is edged with a raised red border, which is worked by taking
all the red stitches of the 1st round of the shoe on the needle and
knitting 4 rounds, so as to leave the purled side of the stitch
always outside; then cast off very tight. Draw a piece of braid
through the open-work row in the sock part, and finish it off at
either end with tassels to match.</p>

<p>327.--<em>Knitted Border for a Bedquilt</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s No. 8 white knitting
cotton; thick steel pins.</p>

<p>Cast on a sufficient number of stitches for the length of the
border, which must be able to be divided by 31; knit 4 plain
rows:</p>

<p><em>5th row:</em> Alternately make 1, knit 2 together.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_339" id=
"page_339">[339]</a></span>

<p>Then 5 more plain rows.</p>

<center><a name="image_327"><img alt=
"Knitted Border for a Bedquilt." src=
"images/image327.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Now begin the pattern:--</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> * Make 1, knit 1 <em>slantways</em> (to knit a
stitch slantways, insert the needle from the front to the back and
from right to left); # purl 5; knit 1 slantways. Repeat from # 4
times more than from * to the end of the row. <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_340" id="page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> Purled.</p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em>Knit 2, * make 1; knit 1 slantways; # purl 5;
knit 1 slantways. Repeat from # four times more. Repeat from * to
the end of the row.</p>

<p><em>4th row:</em> The same as the second.</p>

<p>The continuation of the work is clearly shown in our
illustration. The increasing caused by knitting the <em>made</em>
stitches is regularly repeated in each second row, so that the
stitches between the striped divisions increase, and form large
triangles; the striped divisions, on the other hand, are narrowed
so as to form the point of the triangles. To obtain this result,
decrease five times in the 6th, 12th, 18th, and 24th rows, by
purling together the two last stitches of one purled division, so
that each division has but eleven stitches left in the 25th row. In
the 28th row knit together one purled stitch with one knitted
slantways, so that there will be only 6 stitches left for each
division; these stitches are knitted slantways in the 29th and 30th
rows. In the 31st row they are knitted together, two and two. There
remain in each division three more stitches, which are knitted
together in the 34th row. Two rows entirely purled complete the
upper edge of the border.</p>

<p>328.--<em>Knitted Quilt.</em></p>

<p>Materials: 8-thread fleecy wool; wooden needles.</p>

<p>This pattern may be worked in narrow strips of different
colours, and in that case each strip should contain 1 row of
patterns; or the quilt may <span class="newpage"><a name="page_341"
id="page_341">[341]</a></span> be composed of wide strips with
several rows of patterns, those of one row being placed between
those of the preceding. In the first case, that is if you work
narrow strips, you may use several colours; but if wide strips are
preferred, they should be of two colours only. Our pattern was
worked in wide strips, alternately grey and red. Each strip is
knitted the short way.</p>

<center><a name="image_328"><img alt="Knitted Quilt." src=

the rest.</p>

<p><em>6th row:</em> Slip 1, purl 1, * knit 2, make 1, purl 4.
Repeat from * 3 times more; knit 2, make 1, purl 2.</p>

<p><em>7th row:</em> The same as the 5th.</p>

<p><em>8th row:</em> Slip 1, purl 1, * knit 3, make 1, purl 4, and
so on.</p>

<p><em>9th row:</em> The same as the 5th row.</p>

<p><em>10th row:</em> Slip 1, purl 1, * slip 1, knit 1, pass the
slipped stitch over the knitted one, knit 2, purl 4, repeat from
*.</p>

<p><em>11th row:</em> Knit all the purled stitches, purl all the
rest.</p>

<p><em>12th row:</em> Slip 1, purl 1, * slip 1, knit 1, pass the
slipped stitch over, knit 1, purl 4, and repeat from *.</p>

<p><em>13th row:</em> The same as the 11th.</p>

<p><em>15th row:</em> Slip 1, * knit 2 together, knit 3. Repeat
from * 3 times more; knit 2 together, knit 2.</p>

<p>The second row of patterns begins with the 16th row. There are
only 4 in this 2nd row, so that after the 1st slipped stitch you
purl 3 stitches instead of 1, and in the 2nd row, after the 4th
made stitch, you purl 4 more stitches. Repeat alternately these 2
rows of raised patterns, and when you have a sufficient number of
strips sew them together. Trim the quilt all round with a knotted
fringe.</p>

<p>332.--<em>Knitted Pattern with Raised Embroidery</em>.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s knitting cotton No. 8
or 20.</p>

<p>This pattern is worked in rows going backwards and forwards with
thick or fine cotton according to the use you wish to make of it.
The star-like figures on the knitted squares are worked with soft
cotton in <em>point de poste</em>. Cast on a number of stitches
long enough (19 stitches are necessary for the two squares), work
the 1st row: * Knit 11 stitches, alternately 4 times knit 2
together, throw the cotton forward. Repeat from *, The 2nd row is
worked like the 1st, only purled, in this row, as well as in the
following ones, the stitch must be knitted with the cotton thrown
forward <em>after</em> the stitch, the last stitch of a plain
square with the first cotton thrown forward of the open-work
figure. The number of stitches in the last must always be 8. The
pattern consists <span class="newpage"><a name="page_347" id=
"page_347">[347]</a></span> alternately of these two rows. Each
pattern contains 12 rows, with the 13th the squares are reversed.
The star figures are embroidered with double cotton by working 5
chain stitch in the middle of each square; draw the needle
underneath the knitting to the next centre of a square.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s crochet cotton No. 36;
glazed embroidery cotton No. 10; steel knitting-needles.</p>

<p>This pattern is knitted with very fine crochet cotton. The
middle part as well as the lace border are worked separately; the
latter is sewn on to the middle part. The spots in the thick parts
are worked in afterwards with coarser cotton. Commence the pattern

<p><em>338.--Knitted Braces</em>.</p>

<p>Material: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s knitting cotton No. 8
or 12.</p>

<p>These braces are knitted with coarse white cotton, taken double;
the braces themselves are worked in brioche stitch, the lappets are
knitted plain. Begin at the bottom of the front lappet, make a
foundation chain of 14 stitches, knit 5 rows plain backwards and
forwards, then divide the stitches into two halves to form the
button-hole; knit 15 rows on each of the halves consisting of 7
stitches; then take the 14 stitches again on one needle and work 17
rows on them. Then work a second button-hole like the first one;
knit 6 more rows plain, increasing 1 at the end of every row, so
that the number of stitches at the end of the lappet is 20.</p>

<p>Then begin the pattern in brioche stitch; it is worked as
follows:--Knit first 1 row, then slip the first stitch of the first
following pattern row, * throw the cotton forward, slip the next
stitch (slip the stitches always as if you were going to purl
them), knit 2 together; repeat 5 times more from *; the last stitch
is knitted.</p>

<p><em>2nd row of the pattern:</em> Slip the 1st stitch, * knit 2;
the stitch which has been formed in the preceding row by throwing
the cotton forward is slipped after the 2nd knitted stitch; repeat
5 times more from *; knit the last stitch.</p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> Slip the 1st stitch, * decrease 1 (here, and
in all the following rows, knit the next stitch together with the
stitch before it, which has been formed in the preceding row by
throwing the cotton forward), throw the cotton forward, slip 1;
repeat from *; knit the last stitch.</p>

<p><em>4th row:</em> Slip the 1st stitch, * knit 1, slip the stitch
which has been formed in the preceding row by throwing the cotton
forward, knit 1, knit the last stitch. Repeat these 4 rows till the
braces are long enough. <span class="newpage"><a name="page_357"
id="page_357">[357]</a></span> The pattern is 19 inches long. Then
knit 6 rows plain, decreasing 1 at the end of every row, then work
each lappet separately, dividing the stitches so that each lappet
is 7 stitches wide. Each lappet has 72 rows; after the first 18
rows make a button-hole as described for the preceding one. Work 18
rows between the 1st and 2nd button-hole. The lappets are rounded
off by decreasing after the 2nd button-hole.</p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> Purl the long stitch formed by making 2 in
preceding row, * make 2, purl 2 together, purl 3, purl 2 together,
make 2, purl 3. Repeat from *. (By <em>make</em> 2 is meant twist
the cotton twice round the needle, which forms one long stitch, and
is knitted or purled as such in next row.)</p>

<p><em>4th row:</em> Knit 3, * make 2, slip 1, knit 1, and pass the
slipped stitch over, knit 1, knit 2 together, make 2, knit 5.

Repeat from *.</p>

<p>Continue the pattern by repeating always from the 2nd to the 5th
row; the 6th row is the repetition of the 2nd row, but it is begun
(compare <span class="newpage"><a name="page_359" id=
"page_359">[359]</a></span> the two rows) about the middle of the
2nd row, so as to change the places of the thick diamonds in the

<center><a name="image_341"><img alt="Stitch for Sofa Cover." src=
"images/image341.jpg"></a></center>

<p>This cushion (15 inches wide, 12 inches high) is made of grey
calico; it is covered on one side with knitting, worked with grey
crochet cotton. <span class="newpage"><a name="page_360" id=
"page_360">[360]</a></span> The knitted cover has an open-work
pattern, worked backwards and forwards on a number of stitches
which can be divided by 2, and which must suit the width of the
cushion, in the following manner:--</p>

<p><em>1st row:</em> Alternately throw the cotton forward, knit 2
together.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> Slip 1, knit the other stitches. The stitch
formed by throwing the cotton forward is knitted as 1 stitch.</p>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> Knit 1, * throw the cotton forward, knit 2
together. Repeat from *; after the last decreasing knit 1.</p>

<p><em>4th row:</em> Like the 2nd row.</p>

<p>These four rows are repeated till the cover is sufficiently
large. Draw a narrow piece of red worsted braid through every other
open-work row of the pattern, as can be seen in illustration 341.
When the cushion has been covered with the knitting, it is edged
all round with a border knitted the long way, in the
above-mentioned open-work pattern; it is 14 rows wide, and also
trimmed with worsted braid; a fringe of grey cotton and red wool, 3
1/4 inches wide, is sewn on underneath the border at the bottom of
the cushion; to this is added a thick red worsted cord, by which
the cushion is hung on over the back of an arm-chair. The <span
class="newpage"><a name="page_361" id="page_361">[361]</a></span>
cushion, on account of its simplicity, is especially suitable for

<p>This cap is netted with crochet cotton over a mesh measuring
three-quarters of an inch round; work first a long square for the
centre <span class="newpage"><a name="page_362" id=
"page_362">[362]</a></span> of the crown, cast on 28 stitches, and
work backwards and forwards 27 rows with the same number of
stitches. Then work 34 rounds round this square, and fasten the
cotton. Then count 43 stitches for the front border, and 24
stitches for the back border, and leave them for the edge of the
cap. On the remaining stitches on each side work the strings in 95
rows backwards and forwards on the same number of stitches; each
string is pointed off at the lower end by decreasing 1 stitch in
every row. Sew in a narrow piece of tape in the back border of the
cap; the remaining part of the border, as well as the strings, are
trimmed with crochet lace or with netted edging, No. 311.</p>

<center><a name="image_344"><img alt="-Netted Nightcap." src=

<p>This nightcap is very simple and practical. It consists of two
similar three-cornered pieces, sewn together so as to form a double
triangle; the point of the triangle is turned back, as seen in
illustration, and fastened on the lower half of the same. The cap
is edged with a lace; a <span class="newpage"><a name="page_364"
id="page_364">[364]</a></span> similar lace covers the seam between
both parts of the cap. The pattern is worked with crochet cotton
over a mesh measuring three-quarters of an inch round. Begin each
half in the corner; cast on 2 stitches, and work backwards and
forwards, increasing 1 stitch at the end of every row, till the
number of stitches is 60. Then sew both halves together, and trim
the cap and strings (the latter are worked as on the cap No. 343)
with the following lace: work 2 rows of open-work treble
stitches--the treble stitches are divided by 1 chain--then work 1
row of double, always working 4 double round the chain stitches
which divide 2 treble in the preceding row, or with netted edging
No. 311.</p>

<p>346 <em>to</em> 348.--Knitted Shawl.</p>

src="images/image347.jpg"></a></center>

<p>This shawl is knitted in the patterns given on Nos. 346 and 347.
Both illustrations show the patterns worked in coarse wool, so as
to be clearer. Begin the shawl, which is square, on one side, cast
on a sufficient number of stitches (on our pattern 290); the
needles must not be too fine, as the work should be loose and
elastic.</p>

<p>Knit first 2 rows plain, then 3 of the open-work row of pattern
No. 346, which is worked in the following manner:--</p>

<p>1st row: Slip the first stitch, * knit 2 together, inserting the
needle into the back part of the stitch, slip 1, knit 2 together,
throw the wool twice forward; repeat from *.</p>

<p>2nd row: Knit 1 and purl 1 in the stitch formed by throwing the
wool forward in the preceding row; the other stitches are purled.
In the next row the holes are alternated--that is, after the 1st
slipped stitch knit 1, throw the wool forward, and then knit twice
2 together.</p>

<p>When 3 such open-work rows are completed, knit 1 row plain, and
then <span class="newpage"><a name="page_367" id=
"page_367">[367]</a></span> work the pattern seen on No. 347, which
forms the ground, and is worked in the following way:--1st row:
Slip the 1st stitch, alternately throw the wool forward, and
decrease by slipping 1 stitch, knitting the next, and drawing the
slip stitch over the knitted one.</p>

<p>2nd row, entirely purled.</p>

<p>When 6 such rows have been worked in this pattern, work again 9
rows of the open-work pattern, but work on each side of the 2
stripes, each 6 stitches wide, in the pattern of the ground (No.
347); each first stripe is at a distance of 4 stitches from the
edge, and each second stripe at a distance of 20 stitches. After
the 9th open-work row, work again 6 rows in the pattern of the
ground, then again 8 open-work rows, and then begin the ground,
only continue to work on both sides of the shawl the narrow stripes
of the ground pattern, the narrow outer and the two wide inner
stripes of the border in the open-work pattern. When the ground
(pattern No. 347) is square, finish the shawl at the top with two
wide <span class="newpage"><a name="page_368" id=
"page_368">[368]</a></span> and one narrow open-work row, as at the
bottom, divided by stripes in the ground pattern. Knot in, all
round the shawl, a fringe of scarlet wool; the fringe must be 3-1/2
inches deep.</p>

and all these figures, any combination of initials and numbers can
be made.</p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s Embroidery Cotton No.
20, and Linen Thread No. 16</p>

<p>Lace stitches are introduced in the medallion which incloses
these letters, the outlines being worked in overcast and point de
pois, the <span class="newpage"><a name="page_428" id=
"page_428">[428]</a></span> pens and initials in raised satin
stitch, as also the flowers. The open portion is filled in with
Mechlin wheels, which are thus worked: A number of single threads
cross each other in the space to be filled up; these are placed
about a quarter of an inch from each other. All the bars in one
direction must now be worked in fine button-hole stitch, then the
opposite bars must be worked, and the button-hole stitch must be
continued about six inches past the point where the two lines
cross. The thread must be slipped loosely round the cross twice,
running over and under alternately, so as to form a circle; then
work in button-hole to the centre of a quarter of the circle; make
a dot by inserting a pin in the next button-hole and working three
stitches in the loop thus formed by the pin. These dots may be
omitted from these wheels</p>

<p>Material: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s Embroidery Cotton No.
16</p>

<p>The effect of this design when well worked is excellent, for,
although simple, the contrast between the letters and stars throws
each into relief. Veined and raised satin stitch, with very small
eyelet-holes, are the stitches used here</p>

<p>Lace is of two kinds--pillow lace, which is made upon a cushion
or pillow, and point lace, which is made of stitches or
<em>points</em> worked in patterns by hand, which are joined by
various stitches forming a groundwork, also the result of the
needle above.</p>

<p>Pillow lace is entirely worked on the pillow or cushion, the
pattern and ground being produced at the same time. Pillow lace is
sometimes correctly called bone or bobbin lace, but it appears that
the distinction has never been very nicely observed either by
lace-workers or lace-traders, many sorts which are really pillow
lace being called point, on account of some peculiarity in the
stitch or pattern</p>

<p>The requisites for producing lace in perfection are the
dexterity and taste of the workers, and the goodness of the
material. To produce many beautiful fabrics a mechanical dexterity
alone suffices, but in lace-making the worker must have some
artistic talent, even when supplied with designs, for any one can
perceive that deviations from the design are easily made, and that
the slightest alteration by a worker wanting in taste will spoil
the whole piece of workmanship</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_446" id=
"page_446">[446]</a></span>

<p>The following illustrations are specimens of ancient and modern
laces from Mrs. Bury Palliser's collection:--</p>

<p>No. 419 shows Dalecarlian lace, made by the women of Dalecarlia.
This is a coarse kind of lace, and is sewn on caps, &amp;c., and,
although highly starched, is never washed, for fear of destroying
its coffee-coloured tint, which, it appears, is as much prized now
by the Swedish rustics as it was by English ladies in the last
century</p>

<p>No. 423.--The Bedford plaited lace is an improvement on the old
Maltese.</p>

<p>Honiton guipure lace is distinguished by the groundwork being of
various stitches, in place of being sewn upon a net ground. The
application of Honiton sprigs upon bobbin net has been of late
years almost superseded by this modern guipure. The sprigs, when
made, are sewn upon a piece of blue paper and united on the pillow
with "cutworks" or "purlings," or else joined with the needle by
various stitches--lacet, point, r&eacute;seau, cutwork,
button-hole, and purling.</p>

<h2>POINT LACE INSRUCTIONS.</h2>

<p>The materials required for this elegant branch of needlework are
neither numerous nor expensive. TRACING CLOTH, LEATHER, or TOILE
CIR&Eacute;E, various BRAIDS and CORDS, LINEN THREAD and two or
three sizes of needles, scissors and thimble. TRACING CLOTH is
required when ladies copy point lace patterns, and is the most
convenient mode of taking them, as the design can be worked upon
the tracing cloth, which, though transparent, is very strong; the
price is 1s. 6d. per yard. Fine LEATHER is the material upon which
bought patterns are usually traced, and is decidedly more pleasant
to work on than is any other material. In selecting <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_452" id="page_452">[452]</a></span>
patterns ladies should choose those traced upon green leather in
preference to scarlet or buff, as green is better for the eyesight
than any other colour.</p>

<center><a name="image_425"><img alt="Point Lace Scissors." src=
"images/image425.jpg"></a></center>

<p>TOILE CIR&Eacute;E is only a substitute for leather, and is not
as pleasant to work upon in warm weather.</p>

<p>The needles employed are usually Messrs. Walker's needles, Nos.
9 and 10. The scissors should be small, sharp, and pointed, as in
illustration No. 425. An ivory thimble may be safely employed in
this light work.</p>

<center><a name="image_426"><img alt="Linen Braid." src=

<center><a name="image_431"><img alt="Linen Braid." src=
"images/image431.jpg"></a></center>

<p>The BRAIDS are of various widths and kinds. None but pure linen
braid should be employed; those with machine-made edgings are
eschewed by many lace-workers, the plain, loose-woven linen braid
of various widths and qualities being alone acceptable to
experienced hands.</p>

<p>But all ladies do not care to be at the trouble of edging the
braid, and will find Nos. 426, 428, 430, and 431 very useful. No.
429 is a plain linen braid with a vandyked edge, which works out
very prettily. No. 431 is an edged braid with open holes, in
imitation of the point lace work of the fifteenth century.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_453" id=
"page_453">[453]</a></span>

<p>Point lace cords resemble the satin stitch embroidery in their
close, regular smoothness; the price is 1s. per hank, and they are
of various thicknesses, from the size of a coarse crochet thread up
to that of a thick piping cord. These cords are used to ornament
the braid, and are closely sewn on the braid, following its every
outline, and serve as <em>beading</em> to the edging, being always
sewn on the outer edge alone. The finer kinds of this cord are used
in place of braid where very light work is needed, as in the point
lace alphabet which forms the frontispiece of this work. Directions
for laying on the cord when employed as braid are given on page
500. When used as a finish only, and to impart the raised
appearance of Venice and Spanish lace, it is fixed on the braid by
plain, close sewing. The thread used should be Mecklenburg linen
thread; that of Messrs. Walter Evans and Co. we strongly recommend
as being of pure linen, washing and wearing well; it is pleasant to
work with, from the regularity and evenness of the make. The
numbers run thus:--2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36,
and 40--and will be found adapted for every kind of lace stitch.
No. 2 is the coarsest, No. 40 the finest, size.</p>

<p>In working point lace the following directions must be attended
to: Begin at the left hand, and work from left to right, when not
otherwise directed, as in reverse rows. Before cutting off the
braid run a few stitches across it to prevent it widening. Joins
should be avoided, but when a join is indispensable, stitch the
braid together, open and turn back the ends, and stitch each
portion down separately. When passing the thread from one part to
another, run along the centre of the braid, allowing the stitches
to show as little as possible. In commencing, make a few stitches,
leaving the end of the thread on the wrong side and <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_454" id="page_454">[454]</a></span> cutting
it off afterwards. In fastening off, make a tight button-hole
stitch, run on three stitches, bring the needle out at the back,
and cut off.</p>

<p>Having now completed our list of materials, we can proceed to
lay on the braid.</p>

<center><a name="image_442"><img alt="Mode of Placing the Braid."
src="images/image442.jpg"></a></center>

<p>TO PLACE THE BRAID.--No. 442 shows the design traced upon paper
or tracing cloth, and lightly tacked to a foundation of leather or
toile cir&eacute;e. Run on a straight line of braid for the lower
edge, with fine stitches, working as shown from left to right. Take
another piece of braid, or the other end of the same piece, and
begin to lay the braid by "running" stitches in its centre, keeping
it as smooth and even as possible. The outer edge presents no
difficulty, but the inner edge will not lie evenly without being
drawn in by a needle and thread, as follows:--Thread a No. 9 needle
with No. 12 Mecklenburg thread about 20 inches long, fasten the
thread to one point, and insert the needle in <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_455" id="page_455">[455]</a></span> and out
of the edge of the braid, as if for fine gathering; this thread
when drawn up will keep the braid in its place. Two or three
fastening off stitches should be worked when each circle, half
circle, or rounded curve of a pattern is finished, as the drawing
or gathering thread remains in the work, and forms an important,
though unseen, part of its structure.</p>

<p>As much of the beauty of point lace depends upon the manner of
placing the braid, ladies cannot bestow too much pains upon this
part of the work, which is a little troublesome to beginners. Many
fancy shops now undertake this braid-placing for ladies, who can
have their own pattern braided and commenced or braided alone at
trifling expense. Among these may be mentioned the following
houses:--</p>

<p>Goubaud, 30,<br>
Henrietta-street,<br>
Covent-garden.<br>
Boutillier, Oxford-street, W.</p>

<p>WHEELS AND ROSETTES</p>

<p>The term point lace, or lace stitches (<em>points</em>), has of
late been applied to every stitch executed with Mecklenburg thread,
and many stitches are erroneously named by modern writers. As there
are more than one hundred stitches employed in this beautiful art,
much study and opportunity of seeing specimens of old point lace is
required to give a novice any idea of the various kinds of point
lace; but by attention to the following stitches the rudiments of
the art may be easily acquired and very beautiful lace
produced.</p>

<p>The first stitch is POINT DE BRUXELLES, or Brussels lace stitch.
This stitch, as may be clearly seen in illustration No. 433, is a
simple <span class="newpage"><a name="page_456" id=
"page_456">[456]</a></span> button-hole stitch worked loosely and
with great regularity. The whole beauty of Brussels lace depends
upon the evenness of the stitches. This stitch is sometimes
employed as an edging, but is more often worked in rows backwards
and forwards, either as a groundwork or to fill spaces, as in the
point lace collar, No. 496.</p>

<center><a name="image_434"><img alt=
"Point de Bruxelles (Brussels Lace Worked in Rows)." src=
"images/image434.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Brussels Point is the foundation of nearly all the lace
stitches.</p>

<p>POINT DE VENISE (Venetian or Venice Point) is worked from left
to right, <span class="newpage"><a name="page_457" id=
"page_457">[457]</a></span> like Brussels point. Work one loose
button-hole, and in this stitch work four button-hole stitches
tightly drawn up, then work another loose button-hole stitch, then
four more tight button-hole stitches in the loose one, repeat to
the end of the row, and fasten off.</p>

<center><a name="image_436"><img alt=
"Petit Point de Venise (Little Venice Point)." src=
"images/image436.jpg"></a></center>

<p>PETIT POINT DE VENISE (Little Venice Point) is worked in the
same manner as Point de Venise, but one tight stitch only is worked
in each loose button-hole stitch. This is a most useful stitch for
filling small spaces.</p>

<center><a name="image_437"><img alt=
"Point d'Espagne (Spanish Point)." src=
"images/image437.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 437.--POINT D'ESPAGNE (Spanish Point) is worked from left to
right as follows:--Insert the needle in the edge of the braid,
keeping the thread turned to the right, bringing it out inside the
loop formed by <span class="newpage"><a name="page_458" id=
"page_458">[458]</a></span> the thread (see illustration No. 437);
the needle must pass from the back of the loop through it. Pass the
needle under the stitch and bring it out in front, thus twice
twisting the thread, which produces the cord-like appearance of
this stitch. At the end of each row fasten to the braid and return
by sewing back, inserting the needle once in every open stitch.</p>

<center><a name="image_438"><img alt=
"Close Point d'Espagne (Close Spanish Point)." src=
"images/image438.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 438.--POINT D'ESPAGNE (Close) is worked in the same way as
open point d'Espagne, but so closely as to only allow the needle to
pass through in the next row. This stitch is also worked from left
to right; fasten to the braid at the end of each row, and sew back
to the left again.</p>

<p>No. 439.--TREBLE POINT D'ESPAGNE is worked in exactly the same
way as the open and close point d'Espagne, as may be seen in
illustration No. 439.</p>

<p>Three close stitches, one open, three close to the end of each
row. Sew back, and in the next row begin one open, three close, one
open, then close to the end; repeat the rows as far as necessary,
taking care that <span class="newpage"><a name="page_459" id=
"page_459">[459]</a></span> the close and open stitches follow in
regular order. Diamonds, stars, and various patterns may be formed
with this stitch.</p>

<center><a name="image_439"><img alt=
"Treble Point d'Espagne (Treble Spanish Point)." src=
"images/image439.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 440.--POINT DE GRECQUE is begun from left to right, is
worked backwards and forwards, and is begun by one stitch in loose
point de Bruxelles and three of close point d'Espagne; then one
Brussels, three point d'Espagne to the end of the row; in returning
work back in the same manner.</p>

<center><a name="image_440"><img alt=
"Point de Grecque (Grecian Point)." src=
"images/image440.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 441. POINT DE VALENCIENNES (Valenciennes Stitch).--This
stitch appears complicated, but is really easy to work. Begin at
the left hand <span class="newpage"><a name="page_460" id=
"page_460">[460]</a></span> and work six point de Bruxelles
stitches at unequal distance, every alternate stitch being
larger.</p>

<p><em>2nd row:</em> Upon the first large or long stitch work 9
close button-hole stitches, then 1 short point de Bruxelles stitch
under the one above, then 9 close stitches, and so on to the end of
row (right to left).</p>

<center><a name="image_441"><img alt=
"Point de Valenciennes (Valenciennes Stitch)." src=
"images/image441.jpg"></a></center>

<p><em>3rd row:</em> 5 close button-hole in the 9 of previous row,
1 short point de Bruxelles, 2 close in the Bruxelles stitch, 1
short point de Bruxelles, 5 close, 1 short point de Bruxelles, 2
close, l short, 5 close, 1 short, and repeat. 4th row: 5 close, 1
short point de Bruxelles, 2 close, 1 short, 5 close, 1 short, 2
close, l short, and repeat. Continue the rows until sufficient of
the pattern is worked.</p>

<center><img alt=
"Point d'Alen&ccedil;on, with Twisted Stitch." src=
"images/image442.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 442. POINT D'ALEN&Ccedil;ON.--This stitch is used to fill up
narrow spaces <span class="newpage"><a name="page_461" id=
"page_461">[461]</a></span> where great lightness is required.
Point d'Alen&ccedil;on is worked under and over in alternate
stitches, like hem stitch. Nos. 442 and 443 show point
d'Alen&ccedil;on. In No. 442 a twisted stitch is worked over the
plain point d'Alen&ccedil;on, which is clearly shown in No. 443;
this twist is made by passing the thread three times round each
plain bar, and working the knot shown in illustration No. 442 over
<em>both</em> strands of the bar.</p>

<center><a name="image_444"><img alt=
"Point d'Angleterre (Open English Lace)." src=
"images/image444.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 444.--POINT D'ANGLETERRE (Open English Lace).--Open English
Lace is thus worked:--Cover the space to be filled in with lines of
thread about <span class="newpage"><a name="page_462" id=
"page_462">[462]</a></span> one-eighth of an inch apart, then form
cross lines, intersecting those already made and passing
alternately under and over them; work a rosette on every spot where
two lines cross, by working over and under the two lines about 16
times round, then twist the thread twice round the groundwork
thread, and begin to form another rosette at the crossing threads.
No. 445 shows this stitch much enlarged.</p>

<center><a name="image_445"><img alt="Point d'Angleterre " src=
"images/image445.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 446,--POINT TURQUE (Turkish Stitch).--This easy and
effective stitch looks well for filling either large or small
spaces; the thread employed should be varied in thickness according
to the size of the space to be filled. 1st row: Work a loop,
bringing the thread from right to left, <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_463" id="page_463">[463]</a></span> passing the needle
through the twist and through the loop, draw up tight and repeat.
2nd row: 1 straight thread from right to left. 3rd row: Work the
same as first using the straight thread in place of the braid, and
passing the needle through the loop of previous row, as shown in
illustration No. 446.</p>

<center><a name="image_446"><img alt="Point Turque." src=
"images/image446.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 447.--CORDOVA STITCH is useful for varying other stitches.
It resembles the point de reprise of guipure d'art, and is worked
in a similar manner over and under the side of squares formed by
straight and parallel lines. (See No. 448.)</p>

<center><a name="image_447"><img alt=
"Point de Cordova (Cordova Stitch)." src=
"images/image447.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 448.--POINT DE REPRISE.--This stitch is worked by darning
over and <span class="newpage"><a name="page_464" id=
"page_464">[464]</a></span> under two threads, forming a triangle.
The space is filled by parallel and crossway bars, placed at equal
distances, and on the triangles thus produced point de reprise is
worked.</p>

<center><a name="image_448"><img alt="Point de Reprise." src=
"images/image448.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 449.--POINT BRABAN&Ccedil;ON (Braban&ccedil;on Lace) is
worked as follows:--Left to right. 1st row: 1 long loose, 1 short
loose, point de Bruxelles alternately to end of row. 2nd row: 7
tight point de Bruxelles in the 1 long loose stitch, 2 short loose
point de Bruxelles in the short loose stitch of previous row,
repeat. 3rd row: Same as first.</p>

<p>No. 450 is used for groundwork where Brussels net is not
imitated, and is very effective. It is begun in the corner or
crosswise of the space to be filled. A loose point de Bruxelles
stitch is first taken and fastened to the braid, then passed twice
through the braid as shown in illustration, and worked in rows
backwards and forwards as follows:--1 point de Bruxelles stitch;
before proceeding to the next stitch pass the needle <em>under</em>
the knot, <em>over</em> the thread, and again <em>under</em> it, as
shown in illustration No. 450. This stitch is very quickly worked.
No. <span class="newpage"><a name="page_466" id=
"page_466">[466]</a></span> 451 shows point de fillet applied in
filling a space, with a few stitches of point de reprise worked
upon this pretty groundwork.</p>

<p>No. 452.--POINT DE TULLE.--This stitch is used as a groundwork
for very fine work, and is worked in rows backwards and forwards in
the same stitch as open point d'Espagne, page 457. When this is
completed the work is gone over a second time, by inserting the
needle under one twisted bar, bringing it out and inserting it at
*, and bringing it out again at the dot. This produces a close
double twist which is very effective.</p>

<center><a name="image_452"><img alt="Point de Tulle." src=
"images/image452.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 453.--MECHLIN LACE (Mechlin Wheels).--This is one of the
prettiest stitches in point lace, but also one of the most
difficult to work correctly. It is thus worked:--Work a number of
diagonal bars in button-hole stitch on a single thread in one
direction, then begin in the opposite side the same way, and work 5
or 6 stitches past the spot where the two lines cross, pass the
thread round the cross twice under and over the thread to form a
circle. Work in button-hole stitch half one quarter, make a dot by
putting a fine pin in the loop instead of drawing the thread tight,
and work 3 button-hole stitches in the loop <span class=
"newpage"><a name="page_467" id="page_467">[467]</a></span> held
open by the pin, then take it out, and continue as before.
Beginners will do well to omit the dot, leaving the loop only on
the wheel. Mechlin wheels are also worked in rows upon horizontal
and parallel lines of thread.</p>

<center><a name="image_453"><img alt="Mechlin Lace Wheels." src=
"images/image453.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 454.--ESCALIER LACE.--This useful lace may be varied in
pattern to any extent by placing the open stitches in any desired
order; it then takes the name of diamond or Antwerp lace, according
to the design. True escalier lace is made by working nine
button-hole stitches close together; then miss 3--that is, work
none in the space that 3 stitches would occupy--work 9, miss 3 as
before to the end of row, begin the 2nd row 3 stitches from the
end, to cause the open spaces to fall in diagonal lines--a
succession of steps or stairs (<em>escalier</em>), which gives name
to this stitch.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_468" id=
"page_468">[468]</a></span>

<p>No. 455.--SPANISH POINT LACE is adorned with highly-raised
scrolls, flowers, &amp;c. This is effected by working over an
underlay of coarse white thread or over fine white linen cords. The
wheels are worked by winding soft coarse linen thread round pencils
or smooth knitting-pins of various sizes, and working over the
circle thus obtained a succession of close button-hole stitches.
These wheels are sewn on to the lace when completed. The groundwork
of Spanish lace is usually worked in what are called Raleigh Bars
(see page <a href="#page_477">447</a>), but this lace has sometimes
for groundwork point de Venise. An easy mode of working this
handsome lace is to trace the design upon very fine good linen;
raise the thick parts as above directed, and embroider the whole in
fine thick scalloped button-hole stitch; fill the ground with
Raleigh bars, or, as shown in illustration No. 455, in treble point
de Venise, and cut away the linen from beneath the ground-work.</p>

<p>WHEELS AND ROSETTES.</p>

<p>Wheels or rosettes are used to fill up circles, or in
combination to form lace. The simplest is--</p>

<p>THE SORRENTO WHEEL.--Nos. 456 and 457.--This is worked by
fastening the thread in the pattern to be filled up by means of the
letters. Fasten it first at the place <em>a</em>, then at the place
<em>b</em>, carrying it back to the middle of the first formed bar
by winding it round, fasten the cotton at the place <em>c</em>,
carrying it back again to the centre by winding it round the bar,
and so on; then work over and under the bars thus formed as in
English lace. See page <a href="#page_462">462</a>, and
illustrations Nos. 456 and 457.</p>

<center><a name="image_456"><img alt=
"456 and 457.--Sorrento Wheels" src=
"images/image456.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 458.--ENGLISH WHEEL.--This is worked in the same manner as
the Sorrento wheel, but instead of <em>winding</em> the thread over
and under the bars, the needle is inserted under each bar and
brought out again between the thread and the last stitch; this
gives a kind of button-hole stitch, and gives the square, firm
appearance possessed by this wheel.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_470" id=
"page_470">[470]</a></span>

<center><a name="image_458"><img alt="English Wheel." src=
"images/image458.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 459.--ROSETTE IN POINT D'ANGLETERRE.--This rosette is worked
in a somewhat similar manner to the wheel above described, the
difference being that after each stitch passed round and under the
bars, the thread is passed loosely round in the reverse direction,
as shown in illustration No. 459, before proceeding to make the
next stitch.</p>

<center><a name="image_459"><img alt=
"Rosette in Raised Point d'Angleterre." src=
"images/image459.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 460 is a rosette or star which is used to fill circles of
braid, and forms the centre of many modern point lace patterns. It
is worked upon <span class="newpage"><a name="page_471" id=
"page_471">[471]</a></span> a pattern traced and pricked in small
holes at equal distances. Two threads are employed, one coarse
tracing thread, the other of finer thread. The coarse thread is
laid on thus:--Pass the needle containing the fine thread, No. 12,
through one of the pricked holes, over the tracing thread and back
through the same hole; repeat, following the traced outline until
the whole of the coarse thread is laid over the outline, then work
over in tight button-hole stitch with picots or purls, as on the
Raleigh bars (see page <a href="#page_477">477</a>). This mode of
laying on tracing or outlining thread is also applied to fine braid
and to point lace cord, as in the alphabet No. 400 (see page <a
href="#page_500">500</a>).</p>

<center><a name="image_460"><img alt=
"Rosette for centre of Point Lace Circles." src=
"images/image460.jpg"></a></center>

<p>BARS.</p>

<p>The word <em>Bar</em> is applied to the various stitches used to
connect the various parts of point lace work, and the beauty of the
work depends greatly upon the class of bar and its suitability to
the lace stitches used. The simplest bar is--</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_472" id=
"page_472">[472]</a></span>

<p>No. 461.--THE SORRENTO BAR.--It is worked from right to left, a
straight thread being carried across and fastened with a stitch.
The return row consists of a simple twist under and over the
straight thread; three of these bars are usually placed close
together at equal distances between each group. The thread is sewn
over the braid in passing from one spot to another.</p>

<center><a name="image_461"><img alt="Sorrento Bars." src=

<center><a name="image_462"><img alt="Sorrento Bars." src=
"images/image462.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Sorrento bars are also applied as shown in illustration No.
462.</p>

<p>No. 463.--D ALENCON BARS are worked upon point de Bruxelles
edging, and <span class="newpage"><a name="page_473" id=
"page_473">[473]</a></span> are only applied to the inner part of a
pattern, never being used as groundwork bars. The thread is merely
passed three times over and under the point de Bruxelles stitches,
the length of these bars being regulated by the space to be filled;
when the third bar is completed a tight point de Bruxelles stitch
is used to fasten off the bar, the thread is passed through the
next point de Bruxelles stitch, and a second bar begun.</p>

<p>No. 464.--THE VENETIAN BAR is so simple that it hardly needs
description. It is worked over two straight threads in reverse
button-hole stitch.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_474" id=

The arrow in the illustration points to the direction for working
the next.</p>

<p><a name="No_467"></a>No. 467.--BARS OF POINT
D'ANGLETERRE.--These bars may be worked singly or to fill up a
space, as in illustration. Work rosettes as in point d'Angleterre,
page <a href="#page_461">461</a>; when each rosette is finished
<span class="newpage"><a name="page_475" id=

as in illustration.</p>

<center><a name="image_467"><img alt="Bars of Point d'Angleterre."

<p>No. 468.--POINT DE VENISE BARS (EDGED).--Begin at the right hand
and stretch a line of thread to the left side of the braid,
fastening it with one tight stitch of point de Bruxelles. Upon this
line work a succession of tight point de Bruxelles stitches. In
every third stitch work one point de Venise stitch.</p>

<p>No. 469.--We now come to the most important feature of BARS--the
<em>dot, picot</em>, or <em>purl</em>, for by all these names it is
known. This dot is worked in various ways upon different lace bars.
Dotted point de Venise bars are worked as follow:--</p>

<center><a name="image_469"><img alt="Dotted Point de Venise Bars."
src="images/image469.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Stretch the thread from right to left, on this work five tight
stitches of point de Bruxelles, then insert a pin in this last
stitch to hold it open and loose, pass the needle under the loose
stitch and over the thread, as clearly shown in illustration No.
469, and in this loop work three tight point de Bruxelles stitches.
Then work five more stitches, and repeat to end of row.</p>

<p>By following the numbering from No. 1 to 21, in No. 472, a
square place may be easily filled, and portions of this arrangement
applied to form groundwork of any shape desired. Upon this
groundwork tight point de Bruxelles stitches are worked, and the
dot worked upon these in one of the following ways:--</p>

<p>DOT or PICOT:--</p>

<p><em>1st Mode:</em> Five tight point de Bruxelles stitches, one
loose point de Bruxelles; pass the needle under the loop and over
the <span class="newpage"><a name="page_478" id=
"page_478">[478]</a></span> thread, as shown in point de Venise
bars No. 469, draw up, leaving a small open loop as in tatting.
Work five tight point de Bruxelles and repeat.</p>

<p><em>2nd Mode:</em> Proceed as above, but instead of continuing
the tight stitches work two or three tight stitches in the loop
thus formed, and repeat.</p>

<p><em>3rd Mode:</em> Work four tight point de Bruxelles stitches,
one loose, through which pass the needle point, wind the thread
three or four times round the point, as shown in illustration No.
473, press the thumb tightly on this, and draw the needle and
thread through the twists. This is a quick mode of making the
picot, and imitates most closely the real Spanish lace.</p>

<p>Illustration No. 473 also shows how this stitch may be applied
as a <em>regular</em> groundwork, but the beauty of old point
groundwork bars is the variety of form.</p>

"images/image473.jpg"></a></center>

<p>EDGES AND PURL FINISH.</p>

<p>The correct edging of lace is a most important part of this art,
and care should be taken to work a proper edge for each kind of
lace. Sorrento edging should be worked upon Limoges lace. Spanish
lace requires a full rich edge, as shown in No. 478, &amp;c. The
simplest edge is point de Bruxelles, which is worked somewhat like
the stitch No. 433, and is secured by a knot worked in the braid.
Many lace-workers omit this knot.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_480" id=
"page_480">[480]</a></span>

<p>No. 475.--SORRENTO EDGING is worked with one short and one long
stitch alternately.</p>

<p>No. 476.--POINT DE VENISE is worked precisely like that stitch
(see page <a href="#page_456">456</a>), three and even four
stitches being worked in the loop.</p>

<center><a name="image_476"><img alt="Point de Venise Edging." src=

<p>No. 477.--POINT D'ANGLETERRE EDGING is worked in point de
Bruxelles, the thread being again drawn through the braid before
proceeding to the next stitch. This edging is strong and
useful.</p>

<center><a name="image_477"><img alt="Point d'Angleterre Edging."

<p>No. 478.--POINT D'ESPAGNE EDGING.--This stitch is easily worked.
Insert <span class="newpage"><a name="page_481" id=
"page_481">[481]</a></span> the point of the needle through the
braid and wind the thread round it 20 times, draw the needle
through these windings and draw the picot tight, sew over the braid
the space of 3 stitches, and repeat.</p>

<center><a name="image_478"><img alt="Point d'Espagne Edging." src=
"images/image478.jpg"></a></center>

<p>No. 479.--ANTWERP EDGE.--This edge is only a variety of point
d'Angleterre edging, and differs only in the mode of making the
knot; the thread is passed over, under, and through the loop formed
by the point de Bruxelles lace.</p>

<center><a name="image_479"><img alt="Antwerp Edge." src=

<p>No. 485--<em>Point Lace Border for Handkerchief.</em></p>

<p>Materials: Fine lace braid or cord; Messrs. Walter Evans and
Co.'s Mecklenburg thread No. 24.</p>

<p>This border is suited for a handkerchief or for trimming a
square bodice. The braid is not tacked on by stitches running
through the centre, as is usual in point lace braids, but sewn on
by passing a thread from underneath over the braid and out through
the same hole, as is done by lace-workers with a thick thread; this
forms the design. The stitches employed in this pattern are Raleigh
bars, which connect the work; Sorrento edging, which finishes the
whole outline; English rosettes filling the open spaces. Point lace
cord may be used for this in place of braid.</p>

<p>This beautiful oval is worked in point lace and embroidery. This
is begun from the centre on the muslin by overcasting the space
filled by a wheel. The eyelet-holes are then worked, and the satin
stitch ornament raised and prepared for working. The edge, of point
lace cord, is then laid on, and the under portion edged in tight
and open point de Bruxelles, the centre of the circles being worked
in point de Bruxelles. The light groundwork is worked entirely in
Mechlin wheels, the satin stitch being worked when these are
completed. This pattern can be enlarged and applied to many
purposes. The muslin is cut away when the whole work is
finished.</p>

following stitches:--Point d'Alen&ccedil;on, point de tulle,
English rosettes, Sorrento bars, d'Alen&ccedil;on bars, dotted
Venise bars, and the fancy stitch point d'Anvers, which is not a

<p>Materials: Point lace cord; Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s
Mecklenburg thread No. 36.</p>

<p>This alphabet is useful for marking pocket-handkerchiefs, and
for initials for sachets, &amp;c. The cord is laid upon the pattern
and pricked out by passing a thread up through a hole over the
cord, and back through the same hole; then pass on to the next
hole, and repeat. The holes should be about an eighth of an inch
apart, or nearer when the pattern is finely convoluted. The letters
are worked in point de Bruxelles, point d'Alen&ccedil;on, and
dotted Sorrento bars. No. 501 shows the letter A greatly enlarged,
to show the mode of working.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS AND PATTERNS IN GUIPURE D'ART</h3>

<hr>
<br>


<p>Ancient Guipure was a lace made of thin vellum, covered with
gold, silver, or silk thread, and the word Guipure derives its name
from the silk when thus twisted round vellum being called by that
name. In process of time the use of vellum was discontinued, and a
cotton material replaced it. Guipure lace was called <em>intelle
&agrave; cartisane</em> in England in the sixteenth century.
Various modern laces are called Guipure, but the word is
misapplied, since Guipure lace is that kind only where one thread
is twisted round another thread or another substance, as in the
ancient Guipure d'Art.</p>

<p>In every design where lace can be introduced, Guipure d'Art will
be found useful. It looks particularly well when mounted upon
quilted silk or satin. The squares, when worked finely, look well
as toilet-cushions, or, if worked in coarser thread, make admirable
couvrettes, and as covers for eider-down silk quilts are very
elegant. Guipure squares should be connected by guipure lace,
crochet, or tatting, or they may be <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_504" id="page_504">[504]</a></span> edged with narrow guipure
lace and joined at the corners only when placed over coloured silk
or satin; thus arranged, a sofa-cushion appears in alternate
squares of plain and lace-covered silk; a ruche of ribbon and fall
of lace to correspond completes this pretty mounting.</p>

<p>Not one of the least important attractions of Guipure d'Art is
the speed with which it is worked, and the ease with which fresh
patterns are designed by skilful workers.</p>

<p>GUIPURE D'ART is an imitation of the celebrated ancient Guipure
Lace, and is worked in raised and intersected patterns upon a
square network of linen thread, Mecklenburg thread of various sizes
being used for this purpose. The needles employed are blunt, and
have large eyes, to admit the linen thread.</p>

<p>Materials required: One frame of wire covered with silk ribbon;
one square of Mecklenburg thread net (<em>fillet</em>), either
coarse or fine; Mecklenburg thread; netting-needles and meshes of
various sizes.</p>

<p>The netted foundation, or "<em>fillet</em>," upon which this
elegant work is embroidered, can be made by ladies very easily, and
at much less cost than when bought ready made.</p>

<p>The square is worked by netting with coarse No. 2 or fine No.10
thread over a mesh measuring three-quarters of an inch or more, in
rows backwards and forwards. Begin with 2 stitches, and increase 1
at the end of every row till you have one more stitch than is
required for the number of holes. Thus, if a square of 26 holes is
required, continue to increase up to 27 stitches, then decrease 1
at the end of every row till 2 stitches only remain. The last 2
stitches are knotted together without forming a fresh stitch.</p>

<p>The completed foundation is laced upon the frame, taking the
lacing cotton through the double edge formed by the increased and
decreased <span class="newpage"><a name="page_505" id=
"page_505">[505]</a></span> stitches. If the four corners of the
netting are tied at each corner of the frame before beginning the
lacing, that operation is greatly facilitated. The netting should
be laced as tightly as possible, it being far easier to darn on
than when loose.</p>

<center><a name="image_503"><img alt="Frame for Guipure d'Art."
src="images/image503.jpg"></a></center>

<p>Ladies who wish to excel in working guipure d'art should
practise each of the stitches until they attain perfect regularity
and quickness in their execution. Two or three hours devoted to
this in the first instance will not be time wasted, as the most
elaborate pattern will be worked with ease as soon as the stitches
are mastered.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_506" id=
"page_506">[506]</a></span>

<p>The Mecklenburg thread of Messrs. Walter Evans and Co., of
Derby, will be found a better colour than any other, as it closely
resembles the shade of the ancient guipure lace.</p>

<p>It is sold only in spools of 200 yards each, and the numbers run
as follow; No. 2, 4, 6, 8, lo, 12, 16, 20; No. 2 being the
coarsest, and No. 20 the finest.</p>

<p>The principal stitches used in guipure d'art are POINT D'ESPRIT,
POINT DE TOILE, POINT DE FESTON, POINT DE REPRISE, POINT DE
BRUXELLES, and WHEELS and STARS. POINT D'ESPRIT is worked with
finer cotton than the foundation, say No. 10 on a foundation of No.
6. It consists of a succession of small loops, as will be seen
clearly in the illustration. The learner should begin from the mark
* No. 503, and working a row of loops the length required, turn the
frame and work loops on the opposite half of each square
intersecting the first worked loops in the centre of each
intervening bar of netting. A careful examination of Nos. 503 and
506 will explain this more clearly than is possible in words.</p>

<p>POINT DE TOILE, or LINEN STITCH, is plain darning under and over
each thread; this forms a fine close groundwork, and is much used
in guipure <span class="newpage"><a name="page_507" id=
"page_507">[507]</a></span> d'art. Care should be taken to keep the
same number of stitches in each square, both along and across; the
number of threads shown in illustration No. 504 is 4 only, but 6
and even 8 are used in many netted foundations in fine
patterns.</p>

<p>POINT DE FESTON is worked by a series of overcast stitches, as
seen by illustration 506, which clearly shows the manner of
working. The frame is turned at each stitch, the stitches are taken
across the squares, and increase in length at the top of the
square.</p>

<p>POINT DE REPRISE, or DARNING, is worked by stretching 2 or 3
threads over 1, or 2, or more squares. The thread is darned over
and under, and the needle used to arrange the last stitch while
passing through to form the next. This stitch is very easily
acquired. It is always worked with coarser thread than the
foundation; No. 2 thread should be employed for a coarse
groundwork. No. 510 shows this stitch used to form stars, figures,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>POINT DE BRUXELLES, as shown on pages 506 and 507, is a kind of
loose button-hole stitch, and is used for forming various patterns
and for filling up squares. It also forms "leaves," when the number
of stitches is decreased each row until the leaf finishes off in a
point. Nos. 509 and 510 clearly show this stitch.</p>

<p>WHEELS are easy to work, and are begun in the centre. Four
threads are taken across, as shown in design No. 511; the thread is
twisted in bringing it back to the centre, and the wheel formed by
passing the thread under and over the netting and the crossing
threads. It is fastened off on the back of the several wheels.</p>

<p>No. 516 is worked in point de feston (see page 507) round a
single square hole, which is filled in by a small wheel or
rosette.</p>

<p>No. 517 is worked in point de feston and point de Bruxelles,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page_512" id=

<p>No. 518 is more elaborate, and is worked thus:--Begin at the
place marked <em>a</em>; twist the linen thread 3 times round the
nearest thread, draw it on to the knot <em>b</em>; repeat this 3
times, following the order of the letters; twist the linen thread
also between the threads, as can be <span class="newpage"><a name=

<p>OVERCAST STITCH is worked like embroidery overcast, and forms
the stems of the flowers and leaves of guipure d'art; it is worked
over one or two coarse threads. It is employed in No. 530, and
forms the triangles in the centre of the middle squares.</p>

<p>521.--<em>Insertion in Guipure d'Art.</em></p>

<p>Materials: Guipure frame netting of 6 holes wide; Mecklenburg
thread No. 8 or 10; needle No. 7.</p>

<p>For the netted foundation, which is six holes wide, begin at one
corner with 2 stitches, work 5 rows, at the end of each of which
increase 1 stitch, continue to work the strip with the same number
of stitches, alternately decreasing 1 at the end of one row and
increasing 1 at the end of the next. For decreasing net 2 stitches
together, for increasing net 2 stitches in the same hole. When the
strip is sufficiently long, complete it by decreasing in the same
proportion as the increasing at the beginning. As the pattern is so
clearly shown in the illustration, it will be very easy to work
from it. It is worked in point de feston <span class="newpage"><a
name="page_516" id="page_516">[516]</a></span> and star wheels; the
border is in point d'esprit. The insertion is finished on either

<p>This border may be used for various purposes; it makes a pretty
edging for toilet cushions if worked in fine thread, and looks
equally well for trimming couvrettes, &amp;c., in No. 2 thread. The
netting is nine holes wide, the stitches employed are point
d'esprit and point de feston, the edge is in buttonhole stitch, the
netted ground is cut away outside the scallops.</p>

<p>This square may be used to form part of a couvrette, or a
d'oyley, or pincushion. The three other corners of the square are
worked exactly like the one seen in illustration; the rosette in
the centre is shown in full size. The square is worked in point
d'esprit, linen stitch, and <span class="newpage"><a name=
"page_518" id="page_518">[518]</a></span> point de reprise. Each of
the leaves of the foliage is worked in one hole of the netting;
they are worked by throwing the cotton three times across the hole,
and working darning stitch on them. The stem is worked in overcast
on the thread of the netting. The daisy in the centre is worked
like the leaves, each leaf taking up one or more holes of the
netting.</p>

<p>This strip of insertion is 8 stitches wide, and is worked in
zigzag lines of point de feston, with a border of point d'esprit
and point de toile; a four-point star occupies the centre of the
triangle left by the zigzag line. This pattern is so easy to work
that it hardly needs <span class="newpage"><a name="page_520" id=

stars are worked in raised darning stitch only, and fastened on the
netting at the points of each brand; in the centre of the star
there is a wheel (see No. 515) edged with buttonhole stitch. The
pattern for the centre, one quarter of which only is seen in the
illustration, consists of 4 branches forming small triangles in
point de Bruxelles, 4 open-worked <span class="newpage"><a name=

<p>No. 531. The outer border of this pretty square is worked in
point d'esprit, the inner border in point de toile; then follows a
round of small wheels or rosettes.</p>

<p>For these, fasten the cotton to one of the knots of the first
square stitch of this round, work one loop upon each of the three
other knots, so as to form a slanting cross; then work round the
centre point of the <span class="newpage"><a name="page_525" id=

wheel.</p>

<center><a name="image_532"><img alt=
"Square Pattern in Guipure d'Art." src=

<p>The centre of No. 531 is composed of wheels and point de
reprise; the pattern round the centre is worked in point de feston,
differing a little from that given on pages 505 and 506, but the
illustration clearly shows the difference.</p>

<p>No. 532 has similar borders to No. 531; the centre is occupied
by a star (see page 512) in point de feston; four large wheels
surround this; the square stitches between are filled with small
wheels and with groups of long loops, fastened together in sheaves.
Point d'esprit and point de toile, worked one way only, complete
this square.</p>

<p>540 <em>and</em> 541.--<em>Square in Guipure Point de Venise
(Reticella)</em></p>

<center><a name="image_541"><img alt=
"Quarter Square in Reticella Work (Enlarged)." src=
"images/image541.jpg"></a></center>

<p>This square is worked in the so-called point de Venise, together
with other squares; it is very pretty for covers, toilet cushions,
&amp;c. It is <span class="newpage"><a name="page_531" id=
"page_531">[531]</a></span> worked on coarse or fine linen,
according to the use you wish to make of it. Prepare a square piece
of linen, by drawing out long and cross threads, so as to form
perfect squares. In the pattern No. 540, which is worked on fine
linen, 28 threads have been drawn out, both the long and cross way;
8 squares are formed in this way each time that 28 threads have
been drawn out; leave 7 or 8 threads of the ground, which form the
framework. Then fasten the piece of linen on card-board, and work
close <span class="newpage"><a name="page_532" id=
"page_532">[532]</a></span> button-hole stitch round the inner edge
Then work with darning stitch over the long and cross threads of
the ground.</p>

<p>From No. 541, which shows the fourth part of the square 4 times
larger than full size, it is easy to see how the framework is
darned. When the latter is entirely darned, work the patterns in
the different squares in button-hole stitch. The circular and
serpentine patterns consist of 3 rows of button-hole stitch; the
patterns which imitate whole rosettes and half rosettes are worked
in rows of button-hole stitch. For each row the thread must be
first drawn from one place to the other, as can be seen in
illustration, and fastened on the framework. The knots in the last
button-hole stitched row are made by working in each stitch when
completed, another stitch, and drawing the cotton again through the
first completed knot. It is easy, however, to work all the patterns
from No. 541. The dotted lines in the right-hand corner show the
direction of the patterns which are wanting there. The square is
edged all round with an open-work hem, which can also be worked
from No. 541.</p>

2 stitches, and work in rows backwards and forwards, increasing 1
stitch at the end of every row. The pattern is worked in point

stitches, 1 stitch in all the other stitches. Lastly, darn the
rosette, from illustration, with fine glazed cotton.</p>

<p>For the ground of the rosettes, illustrations Nos. 562 and 563,

<p>568.--<em>Parasol Cover in Guipure d'Art. (See page <a href=
"#page_580">580</a>.)</em></p>

<p>Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s Mecklenburg thread No.
20, and cotton No. 80.</p>

<p>For working this cover, one part of which is shown in our
illustration two-thirds of its full size, work first a straight
strip of netting for the foundation, which must count as many holes
in width as are required for the width of the covering. The size of
the holes depends on the size of the knitting-needle or mesh which
you use. The pattern is worked with cotton No. 80, over a steel
knitting-needle which measures two-fifths of an inch round. Begin
the strip in one corner. Cast on 2 stitches, and work in rows
backwards and forwards, increasing 1 stitch at the end of every
row, till you have 1 stitch more than the stripe is to have holes
in width, on our pattern 68 stitches; then work 1 row on the same
number of stitches, and then increase alternately 1 stitch at the
end of 1 row, and decrease 1 at the end of the next, till the strip
is 250 stitches long. The strip is finished off in a straight line
at the bottom by working a certain number of rows in which the last
stitch remains untouched. At the beginning of the row do not work 1
stitch ever the mesh, but only 1 knot in the stitch of the
preceding row, so that the cotton is drawn on tight. When the strip
is completed, trace from No. 568 the outlines for the pattern of
each of the eight parts of the parasol with double thread, in such
a manner that two parts lie next to each other, but reversed, that
is, the point of one part must lie next to the wide part of the
next part. Then work in each part the pattern seen in illustration,
and afterwards each part round with button-hole stitch, working
over the double outline. Cut out the different parts, and sew them
together on the wrong side with close overcast stitch.</p>

<p>This little work-case, of darned netting and blue satin, is five
inches and four-fifths long, four inches wide, and is fastened with
a loop and button. The back, front, side, and the flap are worked
all in one piece. The netting is worked with white thread No. 12,
over a mesh measuring at least two-fifths of an inch round. For the
flap the netting must be slanted off on both sides; this is done
either by decreasings, or by cutting off the corners of the work.
The latter is then darned in linen stitch, darning stitch, and
point d'esprit, from No. 572, which shows the front of the case,
and from No. 571, which shows the back. The <span class=

is then lined with blue satin, and sewn together at the sides with
button-hole stitches on the right side. The flap is edged with
button-hole stitch; sew on a small button, and make a small loop to
correspond. The case is edged all round with blue silk cord.</p>

<h2>BERLIN WORK</h2>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page_559" id=
"page_559">[559]</a></span> <a name="BERLIN_WORK_INSTRUCTIONS"></a>
<h3>BERLIN WORK INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<p>Berlin Work includes every kind of stitch which is made upon
canvas with wool, silk, or beads. The principal stitches used are
common cross stitch, Gobelin stitch, leviathan stitch, raised or
velvet stitch, tent stitch, and others. The materials and needle
must always be carefully chosen of a corresponding size. For common
cross stitch and raised stitch Penelope canvas must be used; for
small articles, such as slippers, bags, or borders, single Berlin
wool is preferable; for larger ones fleecy wool or double Berlin
wool (the latter, however, is much more expensive). For Gobelin
stitch and tent stitch undivided canvas (not Penelope) is required.
Purse silk is often used for the latter; it is more brilliant than
floss silk or filoselle. Floss silk is generally used for other
stitches because it covers the thread of the canvas better than
purse silk; it is, however, often replaced by filoselle, which is a
much cheaper material. Moss wool is hardly ever used. Before
beginning to work upon a piece of canvas the raw edges must be
hemmed or <span class="newpage"><a name="page_560" id=
"page_560">[560]</a></span> sewn over with wool. Care must be taken
not to crumple the canvas in the course of the work. It is best to
roll one end of the canvas upon a round piece of deal while the
other end is kept down upon the table with a lead cushion. Handsome
artistic patterns should always be worked in a frame. When you
undertake to work a large pattern begin in the centre, and complete
one half before you commence the other. Always work the stitches in
the same direction, from the top downwards--this is very essential
to the beauty and regularity of the pattern.</p>

<p>Always begin with the colour which is used the oftenest; those
colours that lose their dye in working must be put in last. When
the pattern is finished begin the grounding. The wool must not be
drawn too tightly, otherwise the threads of the canvas appear. If
the wool is too coarse for the canvas, one long stitch is to be
made from left to right as far as the particular colour is to be
worked, and over this long stitch, cross back in the usual way.</p>

<p>The plainest stitch in Berlin wool work is the common cross
stitch; illustrations 577 to 584 show varieties of the same.</p>

<p>We now proceed in the following pages to show, by description in
writing and by most careful illustration, all the stitches which
are used in Berlin Work. These are numerous, but neither too great
in number nor too simple or too elaborate in execution for those
who aspire to become Berlin workers.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 577.--The common cross stitch is worked in rows
backwards and forwards over 2 threads in height and 2 in width
(square of the canvas) in straight lines; the 1st row is worked
from left to right; the 2nd row, which completes the stitches, from
right to left. Illustration 577 shows 2 rows of completed stitches
and 1 row in course of working.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 589.--The raised or velvet stitch is worked over
small round wooden meshes, and forms small raised loops. Take 2
similar meshes and as many threaded needles as there are colours in
the work; make first a slanting stitch, as for the beginning of the
common cross stitch, but instead of drawing out the needle straight
under the place where it was inserted, draw it out exactly at the
same place, so as to form a slanting stitch on the right and on the
wrong side; then begin to work over 1 mesh; insert the needle above
it and draw it out in a slanting direction underneath. On the wrong
side of the work a regular cross stitch is formed. Illustration 589
shows 2 rows of velvet stitch completed and 2 rows being worked;
the first of the latter is yet on the mesh, the second being worked
so as to show the position of the wool upon the mesh. Observe that
the rows of the velvet stitch are worked upwards, and that 2 meshes
are necessary, because the lower one must not be drawn out before
the next row is completed. The loops may be cut open if
preferred.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION 590.--The plaited stitch is worked like the
herring-bone stitch. Each stitch is worked over 4 threads in height
and 4 in width. Illustration 590 shows one part of the plaited
stitch completed, and the place where the needle is to be inserted
for the next stitch is marked by a dot. For the next stitch the
needle is carried under the 2 threads below the stitches of the
preceding row.</p>

<hr>
<br>


<p>ILLUSTRATION 591.--The plush stitch is also worked upwards.
Begin to work a common cross stitch, then insert the needle through
the canvas over 2 threads in height and 2 in width, downwards in a
slanting direction. Do not draw the wool close up, but leave a loop
hanging down about four-fifths of an inch long, and make 1 more
common cross stitch to fasten the loop. This stitch can also be
worked over flat meshes. Work a common cross stitch at the end of
every row. When the work is completed the loops are cut open and
clipped, as may be seen from illustration.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS 592 to 594.--Three Berlin wool work borders for
trimming baskets, &amp;c. No. 592.--The 2 outer rows which edge the
border are worked in long straight cross stitch; each stitch is
crossed in the centre with a back stitch.</p>

<center><a name="image_592"><img alt="-Berlin Work Border." src=
"images/image592.jpg"></a></center>

<p>The grounding consists of 2 rows of vandykes placed opposite
each other, which are formed of long straight stitches of different
lengths. The <span class="newpage"><a name="page_570" id=
"page_570">[570]</a></span> squares in the centre are formed in the
same way, and are completed in the middle with a knot.</p>

<p>No. 593.--The ground is worked in cross stitch, the raised
patterns in satin stitch; in the middle of each pattern there is a
cross stitch. The outer rows are worked in half cross stitch over 2
threads in height and 4 in width in 2 different shades. No.
594.--The petals of the flowers are worked over 4 threads in height
and in width, <span class="newpage"><a name="page_571" id=
"page_571">[571]</a></span> and consisting of 4 slanting
stitches.</p>

<center><a name="image_594"><img alt="Berlin Work Border." src=
"images/image594.jpg"></a></center>

<p>In the centre the flower is completed by a knot; the ground in
cross stitch is completed on either side by a narrow border of
scallops, formed of slanting stitches divided in the centre by 1
slanting stitch. It is easy to work these stitches from
illustration. The choice of colours depends upon what use the
border is intended for and upon personal taste.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
